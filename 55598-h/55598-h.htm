  <h2 class='c001'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Shifting for Himself</span>” records the experiences
of a boy who, in the course of a
preparation for college, suddenly finds himself
reduced to poverty. He is obliged to
leave his books, and give up his cherished
plans. How cheerfully Gilbert Greyson accepted
the situation, and settled down to regular
work, what obstacles he encountered
and overcame, and what degree of success
he met with in the end, the reader of this
story will learn.</p>

<p class='c010'>Though it must be admitted that Gilbert
was more fortunate than the majority of
boys in his position, it is claimed that he
displayed qualities which may wisely be imitated
by all boys who are called upon to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>shift for themselves. In the last three years
many thousand American boys have been
compelled, like Gilbert, to give up their
cherished hopes, and exchange school-life for
narrow means and hard work. Nothing is
more uncertain than riches; and such cases
are liable to occur at all times. I shall be
glad if the story of Gilbert Greyson and
his fortunes gives heart or hope to any of
my young readers who are similarly placed.
The loss of wealth often develops a manly
self-reliance, and in such cases it may prove
a blessing in disguise.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER I. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>TWO SCHOOL-FELLOWS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dr. Burton’s</span> boarding-school was in a ferment
of hope and expectation. To-morrow was the end
of the term, and vacation, so dear to the heart of
every school-boy, was close at hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>The school was not a large one. There were
twenty-four boarding pupils, and an equal number
of day-scholars from the village of Westville, in
which the school had been established twenty years
before. It was favorably situated, being only forty
miles from New York. Half the boarding-scholars
were from the city, and half from more distant places.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Generally two or three pupils were sent to college
each year, and, as the principal was a thorough
scholar, maintained a creditable, often a high rank.</p>

<p class='c010'>The school-session was over, and the boys separated
into little knots. The day-scholars mostly went home,
carrying their books under their arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the little knots we must direct particular
attention to two boys, one a boarding-scholar, the
other a day-scholar. The first was Gilbert Greyson,
a handsome, spirited boy of sixteen; the other, John
Munford, of about the same age, and much more
plainly dressed. John was the son of a carpenter,
of limited means, and had already begun to learn
his father’s business. But the father was sensible
of the advantages of education, and had permitted
his son to spend six months of each year at school,
on condition that he would work the balance of the
time. This arrangement seemed fair to John, and
he took care, whether he studied or worked, to do
both in earnest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you feel about vacation, John?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“I was in no hurry to have it come, Gilbert. It
is likely to be a very long vacation to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have got through my school-life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Are you not coming back next term?”
asked Gilbert, with evident disappointment, for John
was his most intimate friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither next term, nor any other term, Gilbert,
I am sorry to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you finished your education, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So far as school goes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry for that. I shall miss you more than
any one else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We shall still meet, I hope. I shall be at work;
but there will be times—in the evening—when we
can see each other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt; but that won’t be like sitting at the
same desk, and studying together. You had better
let me ask your father to send you one more year.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Gilbert, it ought not to be. My father is
poor you know, and it has been a sacrifice to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to spare me half the year thus far. Now I must go
to work in earnest, and perfect myself in my trade,
that I may relieve him of all expense on my
account.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you are right, John; but I shall miss
you none the less. Somehow I never could be
reconciled to your becoming a carpenter. You are
not cut out for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think I will make a good one?” asked
John, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure you will; but that isn’t the question.
Do you think you are better fitted for that than for
anything else?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you prefer that trade to any other business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but I can’t choose for myself. I should
rather be a teacher, or a lawyer; but there is small
chance for either. For either I should be obliged to
study years, and I can’t afford to do that. A carpenter
I am to be, and I will try to make a good
one. Now, your case is different. You are going
to school next year, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Yes, I suppose so. That is as my guardian
determines, and no letter has been received from him
yet. I believe Dr. Burton is expecting one to-day
or to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t spend the summer here, I suppose,
Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am hoping to make a little tour, as I did last
year.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You went to the White Mountains then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and had a jolly good time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where will you go this year?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to go to Niagara, stopping on the way at
Saratoga. I have estimated that I can do it for a
hundred dollars,—the same that my last summer’s
trip cost me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be splendid to travel,” said John, enthusiastically.
“I mean to see something of the world
some day, though I suspect that I shall be a pretty
old boy before I am able to. I have no guardian to
send me money. I must earn my money before I
spend it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never earned a dollar in my life,” said Gilbert.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“I wonder how it would seem if I had to support
myself, and make my own way in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would seem hard at first. It comes natural to
me; but then I have been differently brought up from
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I rather envy you, John,” said Gilbert, thoughtfully.
“You are so much more self-reliant, so much
better able to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the difference in the training, Gilbert. I’ve
no doubt it’s in you; but circumstances have never
brought it out. You expect to go to Yale College
a year hence, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I expect to; at least that has been Dr. Burton’s
plan; but my guardian has never expressed his opinion.
He has simply given his consent to my pursuing the
course preparatory to entrance. I presume I shall
go, however.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a man is your guardian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have never seen much of him. He lives in
the city, you know; but he never seemed to care to
have me in his home much. He is a merchant, and
appears to be wealthy. At any rate, he lives in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>fine house up-town, and keeps up a good style of
living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who appointed him your guardian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I suppose my father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is your father living?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t know!” exclaimed John, opening his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems strange to you; but I cannot give any
explanation. My guardian tells me I shall know
some time; meanwhile I am to ask no questions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did that satisfy you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but when I pressed my question I was
silenced. I was told that I must be satisfied with
being so well provided for, without trying to penetrate
into matters that did not concern me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think it did concern you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I do think; but there is no use in thinking
about it. It would only perplex me to no purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t put myself in your place at all. To me
it seems so natural to have a father and mother, and
sister. How lonely you must feel!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have never been used to them. And that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>makes a difference. Sometimes, to be sure, I begin
to think over the matter and wish that I had ties like
other boys; but it doesn’t last long. But here we
are at your home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in a minute, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know if I ought. I shall be late to
supper, and the doctor wouldn’t like that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take supper with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, take supper with us,” echoed John’s mother,
a pleasant, motherly-looking woman, who heard her
son’s words of invitation as he opened the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert hesitated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little table spread for tea looked so much more
comfortable and home-like than the long table at
the doctor’s, that he was strongly tempted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We may not have as nice a supper as the doctor,”
continued Mrs. Munford, “but you may not mind
that for once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You give the doctor’s table too much credit,”
said Gilbert, smiling. “He doesn’t mean to pamper
any of us, or make us gluttons. I would a great
deal rather take supper here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“Then stay, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will,” said Gilbert, in a tone of quick decision.
“If the doctor scolds, why let him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He won’t feel anxious about your not being back,
will he?” asked Mrs. Munford.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; he knows I can take pretty good care of
myself. Besides, it will be a saving to him, all the
more because I have a very good appetite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All laughed, for Dr. Burton, though on the whole
a very worthy man, had the reputation of being what
New Englanders call close. It was thought that he
was more economical than he needed to be. At any
rate he had made his school profitable, and was
assessed for a very considerable sum in the list of
village property-holders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you do, Mary?” said Gilbert, offering
his hand to a girl of ten, John’s sister, who just then
entered the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty well,” said Mary, shyly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t blush so, Mary,” said John, teasing her as
brothers are apt to do.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wasn’t blushing,” said Mary, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“Just because Gilbert spoke to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are too bad, John,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How soon will supper be ready, mother?” asked
John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In half an hour. Why; are you very impatient?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but I thought there might be time for Gilbert
and me to have a catch in the yard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll tell you of a better way of filling up your
time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am almost out of wood. Can’t you saw me up
a little?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid it will be dull to Gilbert to look on,”
said John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t propose to look on. You shall saw, and I
will split.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like to set a visitor to work,” said Mrs.
Munford. “I didn’t expect you to work for your
supper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall enjoy it all the more. Come along, John.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>You’ll see what execution I will make with your
wood-pile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the two boys passed out into the woodshed, Mrs.
Munford said, “I like Gilbert. Though he is rich,
he doesn’t put on any airs, but makes himself at
home even among such plain people as we are.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER II. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE GUARDIAN’S LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>When</span> supper was over, the boys took a walk,
bringing round by the large square house occupied by
Dr. Burton for his boarding-school. They had got
within a few rods when John observed one of the
younger boys running towards them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s little Evans,” he said. “He looks as if
he had a message for you, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“From the doctor, I suppose. I’m in for a scolding,
probably.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time Evans had reached them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re wanted, Greyson,” he said. “Why
weren’t you home to supper?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is the doctor mad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. He seems anxious to see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. Then I’ll go in. I must bid you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>good-night, John. Business before pleasure, you
know, or rather business after pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope the business won’t be serious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-night, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a small room about twelve feet square,
which was known as Dr. Burton’s study. There was
a desk beside the window, and book-shelves occupying
the sides of the room. Hither it was that refractory
or disobedient pupils were summoned, to receive
admonition from the principal. In his early experience
as teacher he had employed a sterner sort of
discipline, but later he had substituted words for
blows—very wisely, as I think.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert went at once to the doctor’s study.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. Burton was a tall, spare man, with strongly
marked features, and on the whole rather a stern face.
He looked toward the door as Gilbert opened it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, sir,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were absent from supper without notice or
permission, Greyson,” the doctor began.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“Where were you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I walked home with John Munford, and was
invited to take supper there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should have had no objection, if you had asked
me. John Munford is one of my most reliable pupils,
both in study and deportment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was pleased at this commendation of his
friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will excuse me for absence without
permission,” he said, apologizing with a good grace.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are excused, Greyson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Supposing that the interview was over, Gilbert
bowed, and was about to leave the room, but was
stopped by the doctor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stay,” he said; “I have something more to say
to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What else have I done?” thought Gilbert, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sit down,” said the teacher.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert seated himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long have you been here, Greyson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six years, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“In a year more you would be ready for college,”
said the doctor, musing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why does he say ‘would’? Why not ‘will’?”
thought Greyson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I to go to college?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought it probable; but I have just learned
that your guardian has other views for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you a letter from my guardian?” asked
Gilbert, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; it only reached me this afternoon. Would
you like to read it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very much, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here it is,” said Dr. Burton, opening his desk,
and drawing therefrom a letter enclosed in a buff
envelope.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert quickly reached out for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>This was the material portion of the letter, which
Gilbert read with hurried interest:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“Circumstances will not permit my ward remaining
with you another year. I may say plainly that,
should he do so, I should be compelled to defray the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>expense out of my own pocket, and consideration for
my own family will not justify me in doing that. I
have never, as you know, promised positively that he
should go to college. It was barely possible that
funds would be forthcoming which would admit of
such a course; but it is now quite certain that there is
no chance of it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He has already, as I should judge from your
letters, considerably more than an average education,—more,
indeed, than I had when I began my career,—and
he ought to be satisfied with that. He has
led an easy life hitherto. Now it is time that he did
something for himself. Upon receipt of this letter,
will you, as soon as may be, send him to me in New
York? I will then confer with him as to his future
plans.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This letter was signed Richard Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert read it with a mixture of feelings. He
was making an unpleasant discovery. Though he
knew little about his own affairs, he had always
cherished the idea that he had considerable property,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and that his path in life would be smoothed as only
money can smooth it. He was not especially fond of
money, nor did he ever presume on its supposed possession,
but it was certainly comfortable to think that
he was not poor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now it appeared that he had been all his life under
a mistake. He was not a favored child of fortune
after all, but a poor boy,—as poor, very likely, as his
friend John Munford, from whom he had just parted.
No wonder he looked with some bewilderment in the
doctor’s face when he had completed reading the letter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The doctor, though a stern man, felt for the boy’s
disappointment. He, too, had been under the impression
that Gilbert was at least comfortably provided
for.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Greyson,” he said, “I suppose this letter
surprises you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, it does,” answered Gilbert, slowly. “I
always supposed that I had money to depend upon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like to reflect upon your guardian, but it
seems to me he ought to have apprised you beforehand
of what you had to expect.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“I wish he had.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you feel very much disappointed?” asked
the doctor, eying his pupil with interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Considerably, sir. It is hard to fancy myself a
poor boy, with my own way to make in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It might have been worse. You have, as your
guardian suggests, more than an average education.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thanks to you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And to your own application,” added the doctor,
gratified by this tribute.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you think so, sir. I hope it will help
me in life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Undoubtedly it will. Besides, you will have the
influence of your guardian to assist you. He will
probably procure you a good place in some counting-room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish he had told me something about myself;
where the money came from which had paid my bills
hitherto.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked inquiringly at the doctor, as if to
ask whether he could throw any light upon these
points. But he was destined to be disappointed, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the doctor said, “He has not seen fit to take me into
his confidence. I know no more than you do on this
subject. Perhaps, in your approaching interview with
him, he may give you information on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will ask him, at all events,” said Gilbert.
“When do you think it best that I should leave, Dr.
Burton?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wishes you to be sent ‘as soon as may be,’”
said the doctor, consulting the letter. “I should
think you had better go to-morrow, or the next
day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go to-morrow,” said Gilbert, promptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you get ready so soon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will pack to-night, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That shall be as you wish. If you would prefer
to wait till another day, you can of course do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir; but I want to see my guardian
as soon as possible. Will you permit me, as the cars
start early to-morrow, to go to-night, and bid good-by
to John Munford?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Under ordinary circumstances Dr. Burton would
have declined this application, but he felt that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>only natural, and he gave the required permission
without hesitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>John Munford was astonished when, on opening the
front door, he saw the school-fellow from whom he
had so recently parted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the matter, Gilbert?” he asked; “has
anything happened?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Gilbert. “Get your hat and
take a walk with me. I’ll tell you on the way.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER III. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>RICHARD BRIGGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> told his story briefly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you see,” he said in conclusion, “my position
is like yours, after all. I am thrown upon my own
exertions, and must face the world, without the help
of money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m truly sorry,” said John, in a tone of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, John; I knew you would be; but do
you know, I am not sure whether I am so very sorry
myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it must be hard for you to give up the
hope of wealth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I needn’t give up the hope,” said Gilbert, “only
if the hope is to be realized I shall have to make it
for myself. As far as that goes I am no worse off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>than you; but there is one advantage you have over
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a better scholar than I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mean that. You have a father and
mother and sister to encourage you, while I have
no one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have a friend, Gilbert; but he can’t help
you much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that, old fellow. You have been my
most intimate friend for the last three years, and
I hope and believe that our friendship is going to
last. But I can’t help feeling alone in the world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t you ask your guardian about your
father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean to; but I don’t believe he will tell
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any idea what views he has for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not the slightest. I suppose he will provide
me with a place somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you are entirely in the dark as to your
prospects?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Entirely so.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“I wish you would write to me, Gilbert, after you
are settled. I shall want to know all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will certainly write. In fact, you will be my
only correspondent. You must write me about
yourself, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There won’t be much to write. My life will
be uneventful. But you may like to hear news of
the village and the school, that is, after vacation is
over. I’ll write all that I think will interest
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you. You may be sure I shall want to
hear. And now, John, I must bid you good-night,
and good-by, for I am to start early in the morning,
and have not yet packed my trunk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-night, then. Take care of yourself, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same to you, John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the two boys parted, but they saw each other
once more. As Gilbert was about to get into the
cars, John came up hurriedly and gave him a
farewell shake of the hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a capital fellow,” thought Gilbert. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>hope he’ll have good luck, and that we shall meet
again soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>An hour and a half brought our hero to the city.
He stepped upon the platform, and getting upon a
horse-car rode down-town to his guardian’s office. He
had a check for his trunk, but did not claim it at
once, not feeling certain what would be his destination.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a busy street, not five minutes’ walk from Wall
Street, was the office of Richard Briggs. Gilbert
had no trouble in finding it, for he had been there
before. Now, however, he had a new feeling as he
entered the handsomely fitted-up room. He was no
longer the wealthy ward, but as it appeared the
humble dependent of the rich merchant whom he
was to meet. The change was not an agreeable
one, but he had made up his mind that he must
face whatever was disagreeable in his position in a
manly way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mr. Briggs in?” he inquired, of a clerk
who was writing at a desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I don’t know if he will see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He sent for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Oh, did he? Well, he’s in there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk pointed to an inner room, partitioned
off from the main office.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert approached it, and as the door was partially
open entered, and, removing his hat, said,
“Good-morning, Mr. Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs was a short man, inclined to be corpulent,
with marked features.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned as he heard Gilbert’s salutation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you received my letter,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Burton did.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I wrote to him. It’s all the same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I had better come up at once, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was rather surprised at what your letter contained.
Dr. Burton let me read it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You fancied yourself rich?” said the merchant,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; I had always been led to suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never told you so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not tell me I was poor, and would have
to make my own way.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“You complain of that, do you?” demanded Mr.
Briggs, frowning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had known it before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It wasn’t necessary to tell you. As to that, my
judgment is of course superior to yours. You understand,
do you, that you must now go to work?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am ready, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you improved your time while at school?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dr. Burton could tell you better than I as to
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He would be more reliable, of course. Still you
must have some idea. Give me your own impressions.
If you misrepresent, I shall find you out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not misrepresent, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not,” said Mr. Briggs, ironically. “I
suppose you were a model scholar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I was not; but I think I did pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can tell you how far I have been in my
studies. I have been so far in Latin and Greek that
in another year—perhaps less—I should be prepared
for Yale College.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“You won’t go there. You can’t expect me to
pay your expenses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t,” said Gilbert, promptly. “I was only
trying to give you an idea of what I knew.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well. Are you good in arithmetic?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far have you been?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Through the book.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is well. How do you write?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall I give you a specimen of my writing, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Here is a pen. Write anything you like.
You may copy the first three lines of this newspaper
article.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert did so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will do very well. You don’t write rapidly
enough, but you will in time. I shall get you a
place as soon as possible. Where is your trunk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the depot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can have it sent to my house. You will
stay there till I can get you a boarding-place or
make some other arrangement for you. Do you
know where I live?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Give your check to an expressman, and tell him
to bring it round. Stay, here is my son. I will
put you in his charge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A boy, about Gilbert’s age, had just entered the
office. He was the counterpart of his father, and no
one could be likely to mistake the relationship. He
glanced at Gilbert, but did not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph, this is Gilbert Greyson,” said his
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning,” said Randolph, curtly. “Father,
I want five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for? It seems to me you are always
wanting money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everybody needs money,” said the son, pertly.
“I want to go to a matinée this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to go with Gilbert; he is going to
stop with us a short time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s old enough to take care of himself,” said
Randolph, unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can get along by myself,” said Gilbert, quickly.
“I don’t want to trouble your son.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>There was no great self-denial in this. It did not
seem to our hero that he should particularly enjoy
Randolph’s companionship.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At any rate you can go with him to the office of
Adams’ Express. He wants to send for his trunk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you give me the five dollars, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here it is. Don’t come again for a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right. Come along, whatever your name
is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This last polite invitation was addressed to our
hero, who answered, shortly, “My name is Gilbert
Greyson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, come along. I’m in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When they had reached the street, Randolph’s
curiosity led him to say, “I thought you were at
school.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I was; but your father sent for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s your guardian, isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I thought; but he tells me I have no money,
and must work for my living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, indeed!” said Randolph, superciliously.
“That’s quite a different matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Gilbert didn’t like his tone, but did not want to
quarrel without cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>They walked on without further conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently Randolph said, “There’s the express
office. Now you can look after yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He darted off, and Gilbert entered the office, not
sorry to be rid of his uncongenial companion.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Having</span> arranged about his trunk, Gilbert took
one of the University-Place cars at the Astor House,
and rode up-town. Mrs. Briggs might not know of
his coming, and the trunk might be refused.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house was a four-story brown-stone front, with
English basement, differing in no wise from the thousands
of fashionable mansions to be seen in the upper
part of the city.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert rang the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mrs. Briggs at home?” he inquired of the
servant, who answered the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know, sir. I’ll see. Will you send
your name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert drew out a neat visiting-card bearing his
name. The servant took it, and carried it to her
mistress.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Take a seat in the parlor, sir,” she said, on her
return. “Mrs. Briggs will be down directly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The large parlor was showily furnished, in the
regulation style. There was a chilly splendor about
it that carried with it no idea of comfort or home
feeling. Gilbert’s attention was drawn to a family
portrait near the front windows. There were three
figures,—Mr. Briggs, Randolph, and a lady, who
was probably Mrs. Briggs. She had a high forehead,
a thin face, cold blue eyes, and pinched lips.
Gilbert privately decided that he should not like the
original of that portrait.</p>

<p class='c010'>While he was examining it Mrs. Briggs entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Greyson?” she asked, in a chilly way.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I have not met you before. You are
Mr. Briggs’ ward or protégé?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you were at a boarding-school somewhere
in the country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I have been, madam; but the term is at an
end, and Mr. Briggs sent for me to come to the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Indeed! Have you seen Mr. Briggs this
morning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, madam. It is by his direction that I have
ordered my trunk brought here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The lady arched her eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you propose to favor us with a visit,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a slight emphasis on the word favor,
which Gilbert felt to be a sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am at Mr. Briggs’ disposal,” he answered.
“He ordered me to come here first. I hope I may
not give you any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no; you will excuse my remaining with you—I
have an engagement. I will tell the servants to
receive your trunk, and put it in your room. Our
lunch will be ready at one o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Gilbert, hastily; “I think I
shall not be here at lunch. I want to go about the
city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was eleven o’clock; and he was sure he could
not kill the time in that frigid parlor for two
hours.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Very well,” said Mrs. Briggs; “then we shall
see you at dinner. Our dinner-hour is six.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you come earlier, you can ask to be shown to
your room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert thanked her again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I must leave you. Good-morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs sailed out of the room, and Gilbert,
following her, let himself out into the street.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So that’s what they call a city mansion,” he
said to himself. “I’d ten times rather be in my
room at Dr. Burton’s. I felt as if I was in danger
of stifling in that showy parlor. I hope I am not
going to live there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert had nowhere to go; but the city was a
novelty, and he wandered about the streets, looking
about him with the keen interest of a country visitor.</p>

<p class='c010'>A short walk brought him to the Fifth Avenue
Hotel. He had heard of it often, but never seen
the interior. Attracted by curiosity he went in.
He took a seat near the door, and idly watched the
people who were continually going out and coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in. Among the latter he soon saw a familiar face.
Randolph Briggs lounged in, swinging a light cane.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hallo!” he said, noticing Gilbert, “you here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So it seems,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You aint going to stop here, are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For the present, I am staying at your house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, I forgot. Been up there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t she invite you to lunch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I thought I should like to look round
the city a little.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you expect to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose I must get a place. As I have no
property, I must do something to earn my living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t expect to stay at our house, do
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t expect anything. I feel bound to be
guided by your father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see it would be awkward to have an office-boy
at our table, meeting our friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“I suppose so,” said Gilbert, his lip curling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It wouldn’t be proper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you know best.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably father will find you some cheap boarding-house.
That will be better for you, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a pity you were not my guardian,” said
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because you seem to understand so well what is
best for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph looked puzzled. Was this penniless boy
chaffing him, or was he in earnest? Randolph’s
vanity led him to think the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, of course I do. I’ve lived in the city all
my life. I ought to know what’s what. Do you
play billiards?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I never learned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s a billiard-room below. I thought we
might have a game.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never played a game in my life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then there would be no fun for me. I guess I’ll
go in and get a drink. Are you thirsty?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going to the theatre afterwards—a matinée.
I’ve only got one ticket, but you can buy one at the
door.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you; I would rather walk about the
streets this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph lounged into the bar-room, ordered his
drink, then lounged out again.</p>

<p class='c010'>He nodded carelessly to Gilbert as he went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“See you by and by,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert bowed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It doesn’t strike me I shall like that boy,” he
said to himself. “I wonder if his father knows
about his drinking.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert amused himself for a little while longer
watching those who entered and departed from the
great hotel. Then he went out into the street, and
proceeded down Broadway. He made slow progress,
for there was much to interest a stranger like himself
in the busy life of the street. At length it
occurred to him that he would go to Central Park,
of which he had heard a great deal. By this time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>he had strayed to Sixth Avenue and Fourteenth
Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the same time with Gilbert a young girl of
thirteen entered the car, and, as chance would have
it, she and our hero were seated side by side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently the conductor made his rounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>First he presented his hand for the young girl’s
fare. She felt in her pocket, but apparently in
vain. Her face flushed, and she looked very much
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I forgot to bring my money,” she murmured.
“I will get out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By no means,” said Gilbert, promptly. “Permit
me to pay your fare. For two,” he said, handing a
ten-cent stamp to the conductor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind,” said the young girl, looking
relieved. “I live in Forty-eighth Street, and should
not have liked to walk so far. I am sure I can’t tell
how I happened to forget my money; I am ever so
much obliged to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, don’t mention it,” said Gilbert, privately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>thinking his new acquaintance one of the prettiest
girls he had ever met.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you give me your name and residence,” she
asked, “that I may send you the money?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With pleasure, on condition that you won’t think
of repaying such a trifle,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew out a card, added his guardian’s residence,
and passed it to his companion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At any rate,” said the young girl, “you must
call, and let mamma thank you for your politeness
to me. This is mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She handed Gilbert a petite card, with the name
of</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Laura Vivian</span>,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Gilbert. “I will call with
pleasure, but not to receive thanks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After this the two young people continued to converse
with a freedom upon which they would not have
ventured if older and more conventional; and Gilbert
was really sorry when his fair companion arrived at
her street and got out.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER V. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AT THE DINNER-TABLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>At</span> five o’clock Gilbert started from the park,
where he had sauntered about for several hours, and
reached the house of Mr. Briggs half an hour or
more before dinner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your room is ready,” said the servant, who had
received her instructions. “Shall I show you the
way up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you please. Has my trunk come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The dinner-hour is six, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. The bell will ring at that time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert understood that he was expected to remain
in his room till dinner-time. That, however, would
have been his choice.</p>

<p class='c010'>He followed the servant to a small hall-bedroom on
the third floor, where he found his trunk awaiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>him. He opened it, and, taking out his comb and
brush, and a clean collar, made his dinner toilet. A
new life had opened before him, and he could not
help wondering what it would be like. In the midst
of his meditations came the sound of the bell, and he
went downstairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs was already present.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well,” said he, stiffly, “so you found your way
here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see Mrs. Briggs?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how have you spent the day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I spent the afternoon at Central Park.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was Randolph with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. It wasn’t necessary; I found my way
without any trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Mrs. Briggs entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded slightly to Gilbert, and said, in a chilly
way:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take that seat, Mr. Greyson.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Gilbert seated himself, and Randolph, who entered
directly afterwards, sat down opposite.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You were not with Gilbert to-day, Randolph,”
said his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where were you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At the theatre.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humph! you go to the theatre too much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can you say so, Mr. Briggs?” said the
mother, who, though her heart was cold to all beside,
fairly idolized her son, and as a consequence foolishly
indulged him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the second time he has been this week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boy is young, and needs recreation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me it is all recreation with him, and
no work. When I was a boy, I was lucky if I could
go to a place of amusement once in three months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You hadn’t got a rich father,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not made of money,” muttered Mr. Briggs,
“though you seem to think I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife, “it is ridiculous
to expect Randolph to spend as little as you did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>when you were a boy. The circumstances are quite
different.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs frowned, but did not answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you do with yourself?” asked Randolph,
turning to Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went to Central Park. It is a beautiful
place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never go there,” said Randolph. “You meet
only low persons there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw many driving about in handsome carriages.
Are they low?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not. I meant only low persons walk
there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph is right,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still I think I shall go again,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s different with you. You are a poor boy,
aint you?” said Randolph, bluntly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert colored a little.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only know what your father has told me,” said
he.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you got any property of Gilbert’s, father?”
asked Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“This is not the time to ask such questions,” said
his father, looking annoyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? There is no company—no one but
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ahem!” said Mr. Briggs, clearing his throat:
“there was a very small property, but it has all been
spent on Gilbert’s education.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who left him the property?” asked Randolph,
persistently.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was interested in the answer to this question,
and he looked with eager inquiry at his guardian,
hoping that he would reveal what he had so long
desired to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very curious,” said Mr. Briggs, displeased.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s no reason why you shouldn’t tell me; is
there, father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered his father, slowly. “The money
was left him by his father, who was an old schoolmate
of mine. He died in the West Indies, and sent
me the money in trust for his son, to provide for him
as long as it lasted. It was exhausted nearly a year
since, but I kept Gilbert at school till now at my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>expense. Now the time has come when he must shift
for himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rather hard on you, Gilbert,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am willing to look out for myself,” said Gilbert,
quietly. “My father did all he could for me.
I have a good education, thanks partly to you, Mr.
Briggs, and I ought to be able to make my way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you are welcome,” said Mr. Briggs, rather
uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have done more than could have been expected,
Mr. Briggs,” said his wife. “Why did you
not take the boy from school months ago?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wanted him to have a fair education.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me he was already sufficiently educated
for his sphere in life,” said the lady. “I don’t
believe in educating persons beyond their station.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something in the lady’s remarks which
grated harshly upon the ear of our young hero.
What right had Mrs. Briggs to assume that his station
was inferior to hers? The dislike which he had
already begun to entertain for her was increased. He
found it impossible to like any of the family, but he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>had insight enough to see that in cold selfishness
Mrs. Briggs exceeded her husband and son.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me,” said Mr. Briggs, in answer to
his wife’s last remark, “that a good education is a
good thing for any one to possess, be he rich or poor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You wouldn’t advise a boy that was going to be a
mechanic to study Latin or Greek, would you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he liked it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I can’t agree with you,” retorted the lady,
sharply; “I consider it simply time and money
thrown away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you studied Latin and Greek, Gilbert?”
asked Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you gone far in them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a year I should have been ready to enter Yale
College.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And after all I suppose you will be a mechanic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should I be?” demanded Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have no money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose there are other kinds of business I can
learn.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Apparently tiring of the subject, Randolph turned
to his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has any invitation come for me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Invitation—to what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hear that Laura Vivian is going to give a
party. I didn’t know but she might invite me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Vivians do not visit us. I should be glad to
become acquainted. They move in the very first society.
Do you know Laura?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew her at dancing-school. I used to dance
with her sometimes. She was a great favorite. All
the boys wanted her for a partner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is hardly likely she will invite you. I wish
she would.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the name of the young lady?” asked
Gilbert, interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Laura Vivian. What interest can you feel in
her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I made the young lady’s acquaintance this afternoon,”
said Gilbert, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Laura Vivian? Impossible.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Doesn’t she live in West Forty-eighth Street?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it is the same one, as you will see by this
card.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Gilbert produced the card referred to in the
last chapter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How on earth did you get acquainted with her?”
exclaimed Mrs. Briggs. “Who introduced you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe I introduced myself,” said Gilbert, smiling.
“I’ll tell you all about it,” and he recounted
the circumstances of his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She invited you to call?” exclaimed Randolph,
enviously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean to go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall go once, out of politeness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She will think you want to be repaid your five
cents,” said Mrs. Briggs, disagreeably.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think she will,” said Gilbert. “At any
rate I will take the risk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you take me with you?” asked Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hardly think it would be proper,” said Gilbert;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“but if I have a second invitation I may take the
liberty of doing so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert is right,” said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph was disappointed, and indulged in a
sneer at a penniless boy like Gilbert calling on a
young lady of high social position. But Gilbert
did not choose to notice it.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>HOW GILBERT GOT ON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>When</span> dinner was over, Gilbert found that he was
not going to have the pleasure of Randolph’s companionship.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going, Randolph?” asked his
father, as Randolph was leaving the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m going out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps Gilbert may like to go with you,” suggested
Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve got an engagement,” said Randolph, shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When was it made?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t let me interfere with Randolph’s engagements,”
said Gilbert, hastily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you feel lonely?” asked Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, sir. I shall take a walk down Broadway.
There will be plenty to take up my attention.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Randolph can hardly be expected to give up his
engagement,” said Mrs. Briggs. “I am surprised,
Mr. Briggs, that you should expect it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs muttered something about politeness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert protested again that he could get along
very well by himself, and the matter dropped.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he went out, and Mrs. Briggs, who had
been waiting her opportunity, commenced an attack
upon her husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are your plans for this boy, Mr. Briggs?”
she asked. “Are you going to support him in idleness?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly not. I shall find him a place as soon
as I can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What claim has he upon you, I should like to
know?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has only me to look out for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What of that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was the son of my old schoolmate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have old schoolmates, too, and some, I suppose,
are in want; but I am not going to adopt their children.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“This boy was especially recommended to me, and
what property his father left was given in trust to me
for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it’s all used up, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then your trust is at an end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you driving at, wife?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to know whether you expect this boy to
remain in your house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see no objection.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do. You will be pampering him at the expense
of your own son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I apprehend,” he said, “that our household expenses
will not be increased materially by Gilbert’s
remaining here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clothes and board cost something. Besides, he
is not a fit companion for Randolph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is a poor boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has the education and manners of a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>gentleman. It strikes me that he is quite the equal
of Randolph in these respects.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are always ready to side against your own
boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to spoil him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem to prefer this new boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all. Must I be unjust to every other
boy, because I have a son of my own?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know what I mean well enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The point seems to be, that you don’t want Gilbert
in the house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What shall I do with him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let him shift for himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The world would talk,” said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let them talk!” said the lady, independently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t best to incur the reproach of your fellow-men.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, get him a cheap boarding-house: that’s
more suited to his station in life than a home like
ours.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Let him stay here a few days, and I will see
what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs would have preferred to have Gilbert
leave the next day, but decided to accept the concession
made by her husband. He was placed in a
difficult position, but did not venture to tell his wife
all. The truth was, for I do not mean to make a
mystery of it, he had wronged Gilbert most grievously.
The sum of money placed in his hands in
trust for our hero had been not a small sum, but
seventy-five thousand dollars. Gilbert’s father, trusting
all to the honor of his friend, had exacted no
guaranties of good faith. So far as Mr. Briggs
knew, no living person was aware of the amount of
Gilbert’s inheritance. There was no one, so far as he
knew, to contradict his assertion that it had all been
expended in the education of our hero. Yet it
troubled him. He had made up his mind to wrong
the boy, but he was not so hardened as to do it
without some qualms of conscience. He meant to do
something for him, get him a place, and give him a
home in his own family; but here, as we see, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Briggs had interfered with his plans. He could not
make up his mind to throw Gilbert wholly upon his
own resources, and he was disappointed at his wife’s
opposition. He was not wholly a bad man, but the
temptation of appropriating Gilbert’s money had been
too great, and he had yielded. He had used it in his
business, and a sudden call for it would have very
much embarrassed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile Gilbert set out on his walk. The
crowded city streets, which had interested him in the
daytime, assumed a new charm in the evening.
Walking slowly along, looking in at the brilliantly
lighted windows, he did not feel the need of companionship.
In fact, he was rather glad that Randolph
was not with him, for he had already satisfied
himself that they had very little in common.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>Gilbert meets Mr. Vivian.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Half an hour had passed, when all at once he
heard his name called.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Mr. Greyson,” said a sweet voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Turning quickly, he recognized Laura Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Miss Vivian,” he said, pleased at
the meeting.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Papa,” said Laura, “this is Mr. Greyson, who
was so polite to me in the cars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then for the first time Gilbert noticed that Laura
was accompanied by a pleasant-looking gentleman of
middle age.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to meet you, Mr. Greyson,” said Mr.
Vivian, cordially. “My daughter has told me that
you extricated her from a dilemma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t worth mentioning, sir,” said Gilbert. “I
am ashamed to be thanked for such a little thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was a trifle, no doubt, but a mark of kind
attention no less. My daughter and I are out for a
walk. If you have no engagement, will you join
us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With great pleasure, sir,” said Gilbert; and he
spoke sincerely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you live in the city?” asked Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been at a boarding-school hitherto, but I
have now come to the city to live.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do your parents reside here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked sober.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no parents,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Indeed!” said Mr. Vivian, in a voice of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed I have no relatives that I am aware of;
Mr. Richard Briggs, a merchant of this city, is my
guardian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Richard Briggs? I know of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to say, however,” added Gilbert, who did
not wish to sail under false colors, “that I can hardly
continue to call him my guardian, as he informs me
that my little property has been all expended on my
education, and that I am now penniless, and must
work for my living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t consider that a misfortune,” said Mr.
Vivian. “It will make a man of you the sooner.
But about this property, do you know how much it
amounted to originally?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hasn’t Mr. Briggs ever rendered an account to
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. I have always supposed that I should
be rich until within a week. Then, for the first time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>I was told that I must withdraw from school, and get
a place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Briggs has not treated you fairly in leaving
you uninformed as to your real position,” said Mr.
Vivian, gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t blame him, but I wish he had told me
earlier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time they had reached a fashionable confectioner’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in with us, and have an ice-cream,” said
Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, and the three entered
and sat down at one of the small tables.</p>

<p class='c010'>At a table near by sat Randolph Briggs. Looking
up by chance, he was astonished to see his father’s
penniless ward in such company.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove!” he muttered, “that young beggar
has more cheek than any one I know of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He would have liked to have joined the party, but
even he had not the assurance to force himself upon
them. So he sat watchful and envious, his jealousy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>excited by the evident favor with which Gilbert was
regarded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If Mr. Vivian knew he hadn’t a cent in the
world, he wouldn’t be quite so cordial,” he thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Mr. Vivian did know. The trouble was that
Randolph did not know him, or he would not have
suspected him of such regard for wealth and its
possession.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Randolph</span> lost no time in going home to report
what he had seen. Both his father and mother
were surprised to see him back so soon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you came home early,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see anything of Gilbert while you were
out?” asked his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you suppose, Mr. Briggs, that Randolph is
going to follow your beggarly ward?” demanded
Mrs. Briggs, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He might have met him,” said her husband, in
an apologetic tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I did meet him,” said Randolph, in so significant
a tone that both his father and mother looked at him
for an explanation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where do you think I saw him?” continued
Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“In some low place,” suggested his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all. He was eating an ice-cream at
Delmonico’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty well for a penniless boy!” said Mrs.
Briggs. “I suppose he expects us to supply him
with money to pay for his extravagant outlays.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, he didn’t pay for it himself. He got Mr.
Vivian to treat him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Vivian!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes: he had picked up Mr. Vivian and Laura
somewhere, and probably suggested going in to take
an ice-cream.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt Mr. Vivian invited him,” said Mr.
Briggs, who did not allow dislike to run away with
his common-sense.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is certainly the most forward and impudent
boy I ever met,” exclaimed Mrs. Briggs, whose
annoyance arose largely from Gilbert’s succeeding
better with the Vivians than her own son.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, my dear,” expostulated her husband, “I
am sure you do the boy injustice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t call me ‘my dear,’” said Mrs. Briggs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>scornfully. “I can’t see what has got into you.
You certainly must be wilfully blind if you don’t
see through the artfulness of that boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has he done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has wormed himself into the intimacy of Mr.
Vivian; that is what he has done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why shouldn’t he? If Mr. Vivian is inclined
to befriend him, it will be a saving to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t be for long. Mr. Vivian will find him
out, and cast him off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know that there is anything in particular
to find out. He seems to me as good as the average
of boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Mr. Briggs, I can only say that you seem
infatuated about him. I beg to say that I am not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is apparent,” said her husband, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Moreover,” added his wife, provoked, “I wish to
tell you that it is disagreeable to me to have him in
the house. So the sooner you can find a boarding-house
for him the better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I will, if you insist upon it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do insist upon it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“Then I will try in a day or two to find him a
home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mark my words, Mr. Briggs: you will find,
sooner or later, that my prejudice against him is
not so foolish as you imagine. That boy will turn
out badly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all very well hoping; but you’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph now got up to go.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you going, Randolph?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going out a while; I can’t say where.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why can’t you be satisfied to stay at home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s so stupid staying at home,” said Randolph.
“I want to go where there’s something
going on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t a very good plan for a boy of your age
to spend his evenings about the street,” said Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why shouldn’t he go out?” said Mrs. Briggs,
in the spirit of opposition. “You haven’t anything
to say about your favorite being out.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“The city is new to him. If he went out every
evening like Randolph, I should think it a bad
plan.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you would find some excuse for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really,” said Mr. Briggs, “I shall be quite as
anxious to get him out of the house as you, if you
keep up such an incessant attack.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you are going to talk to me in this style, I
will retire,” said Mrs. Briggs, stiffly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suiting the action to the word, she rose and left
the room. Her husband made no opposition. Indeed,
as her temper was, he felt her withdrawal a
relief. He settled himself down to the comfortable
reading of an evening paper, and had about completed
its perusal when the bell rang, and Gilbert entered
the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Gilbert, did you have a pleasant time?”
asked his guardian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; unexpectedly so. I met Mr. Vivian
and his daughter, and went to Delmonico’s with
them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You found him an agreeable man, no doubt?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Yes, sir; he treated me very kindly for a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has a high reputation,” said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he in business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; he is an importer, and is generally considered
very wealthy. He is a prudent, conservative
man, who avoids dangerous risks, and so meets with
few losses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has invited me to call next Friday evening
at his house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better go, by all means. His friendship
may be valuable to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you approve of my going, for I am
sure I shall enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs, clearing his
throat, “as we have a good opportunity, I will say a
few words about my plans for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would, sir. I am anxious to know
what is to be my path in life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I propose to get you into some store or counting-room
in the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. That is what I should like.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“And,” continued Mr. Briggs, rather embarrassed,
“it will probably be necessary for you to obtain a
boarding-place nearer the business part of the city
than you would be here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think it would be better,” said Gilbert,
who decidedly preferred a boarding-house to an
establishment presided over by Mrs. Briggs, who, he
clearly saw, was not disposed to be his friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have breakfast too late to admit of your
getting down-town in time,” continued Mr. Briggs,
who seemed to want to justify himself in the eyes of
his ward for the inhospitable proposal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, I think it will be every way better,”
said Gilbert, promptly. “What wages do you think
I can get, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why,” said Mr. Briggs, hesitating, “beginners
like you seldom command more than five dollars a
week at first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked serious.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose,” he said, “this will not be enough to
pay all my expenses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly not,” said his guardian, “but you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>need not feel troubled about that. I will make up
the balance necessary till you are far enough advanced
to be self-supporting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind, sir,” said Gilbert, gratefully;
“but it appears that I have already cost you considerable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that is of no consequence,” said Mr. Briggs,
hurriedly. “I was your father’s friend, and naturally
I feel an interest in your progress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir; but I don’t like to be a continued
burden to you. Do you think it will be long
before I can support myself?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will certainly be two years—perhaps three.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course I don’t know anything about it, but I
should think my services ought to be worth my board
and clothes before that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We must take things as we find them,” said his
guardian. “There are a dozen applicants for every
place open to a boy, and while this state of things
continues employers will pay low wages. Besides,
it is felt that a boy is paid partly in the knowledge
of business he acquires.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“I have no doubt you are right, sir; but how do
poor boys manage who have no one to make up the
deficiency?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of them have to live on five dollars a
week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Couldn’t I do it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should not be willing to have you. You have
been brought up as a gentleman, and could not get
along as well as if you had always been poor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will trust to your judgment, sir; but I shall
want you to keep an account of all you spend for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because some day I mean to repay it,” said
Gilbert, proudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are too particular about this matter,” said
Mr. Briggs, uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir, I don’t think so. I think I am old
enough now to undertake my entire support.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will see about it, then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This closed the conversation for the evening. Gilbert
was glad to have spoken to his guardian.
Now he knew better what to look forward to.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT GETS A PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> next morning, about eight o’clock, the family
were gathered about the breakfast-table. Randolph
was ten minutes late. He came in looking sleepy
and cross.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph,” said his father, “what made you so
late last evening?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wasn’t late.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may not call half-past eleven late; I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It wasn’t more than half-past ten when I came
in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are quite mistaken. I looked at my watch
when I heard you coming upstairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was rather late; but you needn’t make such a
fuss about it, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife. “You have
been out later than that yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whenever I have been late, I had a good reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>for it. Besides, there is some difference in age between
Randolph and myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At any rate, you needn’t scold him before a
stranger.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not consider Gilbert a stranger. Besides,
what I say is partly meant for him. It is not wise
for any boy of his or Randolph’s age to remain out
till nearly twelve.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you are almost through; I am getting
tired of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus Mrs. Briggs gave Randolph indirect encouragement,
by taking his part against his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs shrugged his shoulders and was silent.
Gilbert felt rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you have some more coffee?” asked Mrs.
Briggs, in an icy tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may go down-town with me, Gilbert,” said
Mr. Briggs. “I will introduce you to a gentleman
who will possibly give you a place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“I hope, Mr. Briggs, you will bear in mind what
I said last night,” said his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>She referred to his getting a boarding-place for
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not forgotten it,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert and his guardian took a University Place
car, and they rode down-town together.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs obtained a seat, but Gilbert was compelled
to stand, on account of the crowded state of the
car.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seated beside Mr. Briggs was a business man of
about his own age.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Mr. Sands,” he said, for it was an
acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Mr. Briggs. Is this young man
your son?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he is under my charge, however. I have a
son of about his age.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he at school?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has been till recently. I am looking for a
place for him at present. It is time he commenced
his business education.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Indeed,” said the gentleman, thoughtfully.
“Are you thinking of any business in particular?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. I shall accept any good opening for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fact is,” said Sands, “I am looking for a boy
to enter my own office. I was compelled yesterday to
dismiss one who had been with me for six months, on
account of dishonesty. I found he appropriated
revenue-stamps, and sold them. I don’t know how
long this has been going on, but probably I have been
a considerable loser.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you will have any such difficulty
with Gilbert, if you are inclined to take him,” said
Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like his appearance, and will take him at once,
if you say so. I have been in the habit of paying five
dollars a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is as much as I expected him to earn for the
present. Gilbert, this gentleman is willing to give
you a place in his office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert had already formed a favorable opinion of
Mr. Sands and he answered promptly, “I am very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>much obliged to him, and shall be glad to be in his
employ.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands looked pleased.</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I ask what is your business, sir?” continued
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a broker; my office is at No. — Wall
Street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid you will find me very ignorant of
business,” said Gilbert; “but I hope to learn rapidly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is nothing that will puzzle you at first. If
you remain any length of time, there will be something
to learn.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have assured Mr. Sands,” said Mr. Briggs,
“that he can rely upon your honesty. His last boy
was discharged for lack of that very necessary
quality.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he will be disappointed in me, so
far as that goes,” said Gilbert, proudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think I shall,” said the broker, upon
whom Gilbert’s modest but manly bearing had produced
a very favorable impression. “When shall
you be ready to go to work?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“At any time, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does that mean to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will stipulate, however,” said Mr. Briggs,
“that Gilbert may be released at four o’clock. I
want to select a boarding-place for him, and that will
give me time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, certainly,” said the broker. “I can let him
go earlier if you desire it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it will not be necessary; I shall not myself
be at leisure till that hour. You know my place of
business, Gilbert, do you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; I have been there already, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember. Very well, go with Mr. Sands to
his office, and come to me at four this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed rather strange to Gilbert to find himself
already in a situation. The transition from life at
school had been very sudden. On the whole he was
not sorry for it. It kindled his ambition to think
that he was going to make himself useful; that he
was to have a part in the busy scene around him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>He only regretted that for some time to come he
could not hope to earn his living entirely; that for
two or three years, perhaps, he was to be a source of
expense to his guardian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will be as economical as I can,” he thought.
“I will cost him as little as possible, and when I am
older I will pay back every cent I owe him, if I am
lucky enough to have the means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Had Gilbert only known it, it was Mr. Briggs who
was heavily in his debt, and the small sum which
would be allowed him to help defray his expenses was
already his own. It was just as well that he did not
know it. It was better that he should feel entirely
dependent upon his own exertions for support. To an
active and ambitious boy it is a stimulus and an incentive
to effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your whole name, Gilbert?” asked Mr.
Sands, pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert Greyson, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have been at school until recently, Mr.
Briggs tells me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“In the city?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; I was at Dr. Burton’s classical school,
in the town of Westville.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard of it. Did you pursue a classical
course?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you know something of Latin and Greek?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. In a year I should have been ready for
Yale College.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you already have more than an average
education.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hoped to have a better, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You need not stop learning because you left
school. It happens that I, myself, pursued a course
similar to yours, and left my studies for business when
nearly ready for college.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, sir?” said Gilbert, interested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I still keep up my Latin a little. Greek I
have pretty much forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time they had reached the office of Mr.
Sands. It was not large, but was neat and well
furnished. A clerk was at a desk, engaged in writing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>There was, besides, in waiting a boy of about
Gilbert’s age, who apparently wished to speak to Mr.
Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You here, John?” demanded Mr. Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” whined the boy. “Won’t you take
me back, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The broker shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I cannot,” he said. “You have deceived
me, and I cannot trust you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t do it again, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I could not take you back now if I would,” said
the broker. “I have engaged this boy in your
place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John scowled at Gilbert with a sense of personal
injury, and left the office.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE FIRST DAY IN BUSINESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>During</span> the day Gilbert learned the way to the
Stock Exchange, to the bank where his employer
kept an account, and to the Post Office. He was also
sent on various errands to offices of other brokers and
business men. Indeed, he was kept so busy that he
found the day pass very rapidly. He made up his
mind that he should like Mr. Sands, whose manner
towards him was marked with kindness and consideration.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not so, however, with the clerk who has
already been mentioned. He was disposed to regard
Gilbert as an unwelcome intruder into the office.
His prejudice will be understood when the reader
learns that he was a cousin of the boy who had been
discharged. He had interceded to have John reinstated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in his place; but Mr. Sands had been inexorable.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to oblige you, Mr. Moore,” said he,
“but I cannot take back your cousin. I must have a
boy in whom I can feel a reasonable degree of confidence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“John has reformed, sir. He will be strictly
honest hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope he will, for his own sake; but it is best for
him to find some place where there will be fewer
opportunities to steal.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk saw that it would be of no use to pursue
the subject further, and was silent. But he made up
his mind to dislike any boy that might come in his
cousin’s place.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his employer’s presence he did not venture to
manifest his feelings, but when Gilbert came back
from an errand later in the day, Mr. Sands being
absent at the Board, he said irritably, “What made
you so long?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So long?” repeated Gilbert, in surprise. “I
lost no time, Mr. Moore. I went directly to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>office where I was sent, and as soon as my business
was attended to I came directly back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no doubt!” sneered Moore. “You didn’t
stop to play on the way, <i>of course</i>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I didn’t,” said Gilbert, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you stopped to hear a hand-organ, or something
of the kind,” persisted Moore, in a disagreeable
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are quite mistaken, Mr. Moore. You probably
know where the office is, and must be aware that
I had no time for any such delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you are a model boy, I have no doubt!”
sneered the clerk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have great doubts on the subject myself,” said
Gilbert, good-naturedly. “I never had that reputation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever do anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt I have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought perhaps you were intending to pass
yourself off as an angel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe there are many angels in Wall
Street,” said Gilbert, in the same tone of good-humor.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“No more of your impudence!” said Moore, snappishly,
feeling that Gilbert had the better of him in
this little passage of words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What have I said that is impudent?” asked
Gilbert, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter. Go to your work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a disagreeable fellow!” thought our hero.
“I don’t think I shall enjoy having him over me.
He seems determined to find fault.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go over to Smith &amp; Dixon’s, and ask them for a
Union Pacific First, on our account—stay; here’s an
order.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And don’t be gone all day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be back as soon as I can,” said Gilbert,
coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mind you do!” said Moore, in an aggravating
manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a comfort to Gilbert that Mr. Moore did not
venture to treat him in this way while Mr. Sands was
in the office. Then, if he had occasion to speak, it
was in a proper tone. But for two or three hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>during the day the broker was absent at the Stock
Exchange, and during this period the clerk saw fit
to treat him with rudeness. This treatment, which
commenced on the first day, was continued. Gilbert
made little effort to conciliate Simon Moore (this
was the clerk’s full name), for he saw in advance that
he would have small chance of succeeding. He was
convinced of it when he discovered the relationship
between Moore and his predecessor, and learned,
moreover, that the clerk was a boarder in his cousin’s
family.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall have to be very careful,” thought Gilbert,
“or Mr. Moore will get me into trouble of some kind.
He wants to get rid of me, for some reason or other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert came to the only sensible determination:
to do his duty as well and faithfully as he knew how,
and trust to Providence for the issue. He decided
not to trouble himself too much about the clerk’s
enmity, since he knew that he had done nothing to
deserve it.</p>

<p class='c010'>At a little before four Gilbert left the office, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>sought the counting-room of Mr. Briggs. He found
that gentleman ready to go up-town.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Gilbert,” he said, “how do you like your
first day in business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, sir. I think I shall get on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you don’t find your duties hard?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; they are pleasant and easy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will find Mr. Sands very considerate and
kind, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like him already, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is well,” said Mr. Briggs, in a tone of
satisfaction. “The next thing is to find you a boarding-place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. I shall be very glad to get settled.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There will be little difficulty about that. If we
start immediately, I can select a place for you this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They took the street-cars at the Astor House.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been thinking, Gilbert,” said his guardian,
“that Waverly Place or Clinton Place will be a good
location for you. It is not so far but that on pleasant
days you can walk to your place of business. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>will save car-fare, which, though a small matter, is
yet to be considered where your income is so small.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far is it, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“About two miles from Wall Street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shan’t mind that. When at school I used to
walk ten miles sometimes, on holidays.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mind, Gilbert, I only recommend it. I will see
that you have money enough to get along comfortably,
even if you choose to ride constantly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall enjoy the walk when it is pleasant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clinton Place is the western portion of Eighth
Street,” said Mr. Briggs. “East Eighth Street is
known as St. Mark’s Place. There are numerous
boarding-houses there also, but I think you will like
Clinton Place better. I suppose you are not very
familiar with the streets yet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; but I shall get accustomed to them as
soon as possible. I found, this morning, that it is
a useful thing to know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>About twenty minutes’ ride brought the car to
Clinton Place.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will get out here,” said Mr. Briggs. “As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>we pass through the street,” he said, “we shall probably
notice papers pasted on some of the houses,
indicating that boarders or lodgers will be received.
At some of these houses we will inquire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was as Mr. Briggs had said. They had scarcely
began their walk towards Broadway, when they saw
such a paper on a neat-looking brick house.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us inquire here, Gilbert,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went up the steps, and rang the bell. On a
servant appearing, he announced his business. This
brought about an interview with the landlady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you wish a room for two?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; only for this boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have a hall bedroom on the third floor, and
an attic room,” said the landlady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will look at the hall bedroom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a small room, about seven feet by nine, and
the furniture was very common.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t expect anything very luxurious,
Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs. “Shall you be contented
with this room?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” answered Gilbert, promptly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“What is your price, madam?” asked Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“With board, six dollars a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we will try it,” he said. “Will you stay
here to-night, or come to-morrow, Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert thought of Mrs. Briggs, and answered, “I
will begin now. I suppose I shall need to send for
my trunk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will send it by an expressman—to-night, if
possible.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the case of strangers,” said the landlady, hesitating,
“we expect something in advance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will pay you a week in advance,” said Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew six dollars from his pocket-book, and
handed it to the smiling landlady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, sir,” she said apologetically, “it
isn’t necessary with a gentleman like you, but it is
our custom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite right, madam. I may as well tell you that
I will be responsible for this boy’s board. Here is
my card.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Mr. Briggs was a well-known business man, and
his name was familiar to the landlady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to have a friend of yours in my house,”
she said. “I hope the young gentleman will find
everything satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he will be hard to please. Good-evening,
madam. Good-night, Gilbert. You must
call and see us often.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs withdrew, and Gilbert sat down on the
bed and tried to realize his new position. Less than
a week had elapsed since he left school. Now he had
entered on a business career in New York. It made
him feel years older, but he did not shrink from his
new responsibilities. He rather liked them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER X. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE NEW BOARDING-HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Not</span> long after Gilbert took possession of his room,
the bell rang for dinner. As at most New York
boarding-houses, the last meal of the day was dinner,
not supper. Gilbert heard an adjoining door open,
and, leaving his own room, followed the occupants
down to the dining-room, which proved to be in the
front basement.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room was deep, and allowed of a long table,
large enough for the accommodation of sixteen
boarders. Mrs. White, the landlady, did not herself
sit down to the table, but superintended the
servants, who acted as waiters.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where shall I sit, Mrs. White?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may sit here, between Mr. Ingalls and Miss
Brintnall.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Neither of these persons had appeared, but Gilbert
took the seat pointed out.</p>

<p class='c010'>One by one the boarders entered, until the table
was full. Gilbert looked about him with considerable
curiosity. Mr. Ingalls proved to be a young man
of twenty-five, who was employed in a wholesale
stationery store in William Street. Miss Brintnall
was an elderly-looking young lady, who was engaged
as teacher in one of the public schools of the city.
Her face was of a masculine type, and Gilbert was
not surprised to hear that she was a strong advocate
of woman’s rights.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just opposite were seated Mr. and Mrs. Theophilus
Bower. He was clerk in a dry goods house, and had
been but three months married. He was an inoffensive
young man, with hair parted in the middle, who
appeared to be very fond of his young wife, who wore
long ringlets, and seemed quite a fitting match for
her husband. Gilbert was rather amused by the
manner in which they addressed each other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Theophilus, my love, may I pass you the salt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Occasionally, that is, as often as opportunity
offered, they would press each other’s hands under the
table, the pressure being accompanied by a languishing
look, which nearly upset the gravity of Mr. Ingalls,
who, in his endeavors to suppress his merriment,
once came so near choking that he had to leave the
table.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the other side of Mr. Ingalls sat an actor at
one of the city theatres, with his wife. He seldom
engaged in general conversation, but spoke in low
tones to his wife. Whether this sprang from natural
reserve, or from his mind being preoccupied with his
business, opinion was divided; but the natural consequence
was that he was unpopular.</p>

<p class='c010'>There were several other boarders, who will be
referred to in due time. Among them may be mentioned
Alphonso Jones, a man of thirty, whose seedy
attire would seem to indicate limited means, but who
lost no opportunity of boasting of his aristocratic
connections, and his intimacy with the best society.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls was the first to notice his young neighbor.
Mrs. White had introduced Gilbert to his right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and left hand neighbor, but left him to make acquaintance
with the rest as he could.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you been long in the city, Mr. Greyson?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Gilbert, “but a few days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you are on business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am in a broker’s office on Wall Street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I am in a wholesale stationery store not far
from Wall Street. If you have no better company,
we might go down-town together in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, I should like company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is, if you walk; I never ride except on
stormy days.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor shall I. It’s only two miles, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Scarcely that; some think two miles a long walk.
My brother from Boston, who was here for a while,
complained a good deal of the long distances in New
York. In Boston business men have much less
distance to travel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never was in Boston,” said Gilbert. “Is it a
pleasant city?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the ‘Hub of the Universe,’ you know; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Dr. Holmes calls it, at any rate. Yes, it is a pleasant
city, but small, of course, compared with New York.
How did you happen to come to this boarding-house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw a notice outside that boarders would be
taken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so. I am not very difficult to suit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not been long in your place of business,
I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; I went there only to-day. I have always
been at school till now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Out of the city?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, at Dr. Burton’s Boarding School, at Westville.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then, lowering his voice, he said, “I see, Mr.
Greyson, you are looking at the happy couple opposite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They seem very happy,” said Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, they are wrapt up in each other. However,
that is better than to quarrel all the time. Do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>you see that tall, thin man at the end of the table,
and the lady at his side?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There isn’t much love-making between them.
They have a room adjoining mine, and I have the
privilege of listening to some of their disputes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are they?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Major McDonald and his wife. He is Scotch, I
believe. They married each other for their money,
I hear, and then discovered that neither had any to
speak of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The conversation was interrupted by Miss Brintnall,
who was expressing her views on woman’s
rights.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In my opinion,” she said, “man is a cruel and
despotic tyrant. He monopolizes the good things of
this life, and only throws an occasional crumb to poor,
ill-used women. Women, for the same work, are paid
less than half as much as men. Take myself, for
example. I work just as hard as the principal of my
school, yet he gets three dollars to my one. Now, I
want to know where is the justice of that?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Perhaps,” suggested Mr. Bower, “he has a wife
and children to support. You haven’t, you know,
Miss Brintnall. Of course, you couldn’t, you know,”
he added, with a simper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I might have a husband and children to support,
I suppose,” said Miss Brintnall, severely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is the case, Miss Brintnall,” said Mr.
Ingalls, humorously, “you ought to let us know, that
we may not cherish vain hopes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Brintnall smiled; she generally did smile on
Mr. Ingalls, who was a favorite of hers. Indeed, it
was generally thought at the table that she would
have had no objection to becoming Mrs. Ingalls,
though the young man certainly had never given her
any encouragement, save by such jocular remarks as
the foregoing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will have your joke, Mr. Ingalls,” she said
good-humoredly; “but to return to my argument. Is
there any one present that can deny the correctness of
my statement, that man is a tyrant?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can,” said little Mrs. Bower, indignantly.
“My Theophilus isn’t a tyrant, are you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“I hope not, my love,” he answered, pressing her
hand under the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls came near swallowing a piece of meat
the wrong way, and Miss Brintnall sniffed contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There may be exceptions,” she said, “but they
only prove the rule; even in your own case, Mrs.
Bower, you may change your mind some years
hence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never shall, I am sure. Shall I, Theophilus,
dear?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, my love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Mr. Ingalls squeezed Gilbert’s hand under
the table, with a comic look, which proved very trying
to our hero’s gravity.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miss Brintnall received unexpected help from Mrs.
McDonald.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I agree with you entirely, Miss Brintnall,” said
that lady, “and I don’t believe there are any exceptions.
Men always try to domineer over women.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My experience is the other way,” said the major.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Of course, I expected to hear you say so,” said
the lady, tossing her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Men are very forbearing, in my opinion,” proceeded
the major.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And very unselfish, I suppose,” sneered his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s where you hit the nail on the head,
ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think,” said Alphonso Jones, “it depends very
much on social rank. I have the privilege of being
intimately acquainted with some of our very highest
families, and I can assure you that they are very
harmonious. Among the lower orders, no doubt,
men often act like brutes; but it is from lack of
refinement. My friends, the Tiptops, who have their
villa at Newport, never exchange a rude word. I
think you are too sweeping in your remarks, Miss
Brintnall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not the honor of knowing your grand
friends, Mr. Jones,” said Miss Brintnall, sarcastically;
“but I contend that human nature is everywhere
the same. Money and rank don’t change it. I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>it very likely that some of your Fifth Avenue
grandees beat their wives.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“O Miss Brintnall!” exclaimed Mr. Bower and
Mr. Jones in chorus.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I do believe it. I won’t take a word back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t believe your husband will ever beat you,
Miss Brintnall,” said Mr. Ingalls, slyly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think not,” said the teacher, decidedly. “I
should allow him all the rights which he could fairly
claim, but I would not let him infringe upon mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t marry her for a million dollars,”
whispered Mr. Bower to his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t she horrid?” was the shuddering reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here some one started a new topic of conversation,
and Miss Brintnall subsided.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A NEW ARRANGEMENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>About</span> nine o’clock that evening Gilbert’s trunk
arrived. He received it with satisfaction, and unpacked
it at once, putting a part of his clothing into
the drawers of a small bureau, which, with the bedstead
and one chair, took up about all the space in his
contracted chamber.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls stepped in as he was unpacking.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t got much extra room,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I wish my room was larger,” said Gilbert;
“but it is as large as I can afford.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My room is at least twice as large, but by sharing
it with another I pay no more than you do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are in luck; that is, if your room-mate is
agreeable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We get along very well, but I expect to lose him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in a week. He is to leave the city. If you would
like to take his place, I shall be glad to have you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will it increase my board?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much do you pay now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; you would pay the same as my room-mate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will accept your offer with thanks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you won’t have cause to repent it,” said
Mr. Ingalls. “If you do at any time I will let
you off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you should marry Miss Brintnall,” suggested
Gilbert, with a smile, “you will have to give me
warning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No Miss Brintnall for me!” said Ingalls. “I
don’t want to be a henpecked husband, or marry one
who would insist on wearing the breeches.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The lady seems partial to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is not only partial, but martial,” said the
young man, who was apt to indulge in poor jokes; “I
would as soon marry an Amazon. When you get
through unpacking, come to my room; you may like
to see it.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“I have unpacked as much as I intend to to-night.
I will go with you now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls’ room was square in shape, and of very
good dimensions; it was better furnished also than
Gilbert’s. It contained two single beds, side by side,
a good closet, a sofa, a bureau, rocking-chair, and
several ordinary chairs. Several fair engravings
adorned the walls, and Gilbert felt that it would be
decidedly pleasanter for him to share such a room as
this with a pleasant companion, than to reign sole
master of a hall bedroom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you like it?” asked Mr. Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very much better than mine. I shall be glad to
change.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we will consider the arrangement decided
upon. Can I offer you a cigarette?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you; I never smoke.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is where you are sensible; I only indulge
myself occasionally.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They sat for half an hour and chatted. Gilbert
was favorably impressed by his new friend, who,
though ten years older than himself, proved a congenial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>companion. At ten o’clock he bade him good-night,
and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>His bed was not particularly soft or luxurious, but
he slept soundly, and awoke in the morning refreshed.
He took an early breakfast, and walked down-town
with Mr. Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Mr. Moore, the book-keeper, arrived, Gilbert
was already at work.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A new broom sweeps clean,” sneered Moore, in
an unpleasant tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean me?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; you are trying to make Mr. Sands think
you a model.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope he won’t think that, for he will find out his
mistake.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He <i>will</i> find out his mistake,” said Moore; “I
predict that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I intend to do my work faithfully,” said Gilbert;
“there will be no mistake about that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve heard boys talk that way before. They
don’t deceive me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Just then Mr. Sands entered. He greeted Gilbert
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you are on hand in good season. I like to
see that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall try not to be late, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where do you board?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In Waverly Place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is convenient as regards distance. You may
go to the Post Office for letters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As Gilbert started for the Post Office, a boy about
his own age came up and joined him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you Mr. Sands’ new boy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve got my place, then. I used to be there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you? I am sorry to have interfered with
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t like it. He is very hard to get along
with.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He doesn’t look like it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He discharged me for just nothing at all. That’s
what my cousin, the book-keeper, says.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mr. Moore your cousin?” asked Gilbert, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>began now to understand the cause of his own unpopularity
with that official.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; he lives at our house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert said nothing, judging that it would be
repeated.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will get another place,” he said,
politely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want another place. I want to be where
my cousin is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert felt rather awkward.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is natural,” he said; “I am sorry you are
disappointed, but, of course, I am glad to get a place.
I have to shift for myself, and it is necessary I should
be earning money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t stay long; old Sands will discharge
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not. If I do my duty faithfully, I don’t
see why he should.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That won’t make any difference. Didn’t I discharge
my duty faithfully?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert did not know, and expressed no opinion.
Moreover, he thought he would not inquire, preferring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to remain neutral. Besides, he doubted
whether he could fully rely on the correctness of
John’s statements.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to lose my place,” he said; “but if
I do, I hope you will get it back again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose you resign in my favor,” suggested John,
in an insinuating manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would rather not,” answered Gilbert, who felt
that this request was decidedly cool.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just as I thought,” muttered John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sands would not thank me for meddling with
what is not my business. If he chooses, at any time,
to put you back and dismiss me, he’ll do so without
any request from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John did not vouchsafe an answer, but walked off
sullenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing of any importance occurred during the
day, except that Gilbert found the book-keeper as
disagreeable as ever. It seemed impossible to suit
him. This Gilbert correctly attributed to his disappointment
that his cousin had been superseded.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>About the hour of closing, Gilbert was surprised
at the entrance of Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How are you getting on, Gilbert?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think you shall like this place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, I think so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you don’t regret leaving school?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, I do; but that can’t be helped, and I
don’t trouble myself with thinking of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right there; are you ready to go up
town?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come along with me, then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When they were in the street, Mr. Briggs said,
“I will tell you in a few words what I mean to do for
you, so that you can have a fair understanding about
money matters. I shall pay your board, and out of
your wages you will be able to buy your clothes and
provide for your other expenses.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, Mr. Briggs,” said Gilbert, “I shall be able
to pay part of my board. I do not wish to be such a
burden to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Say no more about it,” said his guardian, hastily,
“I insist upon that arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, sir, I shall want sometime to repay you for
the money you spend on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you are a rich man, I will permit you to
do so. Till then, think nothing of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am at least very grateful to you for your kindness,”
said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some reason Mr. Briggs seemed uncomfortable
whenever Gilbert spoke of gratitude, and tried to drop
the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph spoke of calling to see you this evening,”
he said. “Shall you be at home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, I shall be glad to have him come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was rather astonished at such a mark of
attention on the part of the young aristocrat, but
determined to treat him cordially, for his father’s
sake.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>RANDOLPH’S CALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Randolph</span> had expressed to his father in the morning
an intention of calling upon Gilbert. His motive
was not interest in our hero’s welfare, but curiosity
to find out how he was situated, as indeed he freely
acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t call if I were you, Randolph,” said
his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” asked her husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert will move in a different sphere,” said Mrs.
Briggs, loftily. “I do not wish my son to form
intimacies beneath him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t intend to,” said Randolph; “I want to
see what sort of a place he is in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will be likely to presume upon your condescension,
and boast of you as one of his friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs understood Gilbert better.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No fear of that!” he said. “Gilbert is a boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of spirit. He is not one to seek or accept patronage.
His pride is quite as great as Randolph’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has he to be proud of, I should like to
know,” said Mrs. Briggs, with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is my ward,” said Mr. Briggs, stiffly, “and it
is quite proper that my son should pay him some
attention.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem to be infatuated about that boy,”
said his wife coldly. “I suppose you will want
him invited to Randolph’s birthday party next month.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I certainly shall,” said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is going rather too far,” said his wife angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However that may be, he must be invited.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should think I had some voice in that matter,
Mr. Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Unless Gilbert Greyson is invited, there shall be
no party at all,” said Mr. Briggs, with decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs felt that the fiat had gone forth. Her
husband generally yielded to her, but sometimes he
put his foot down, as the saying is, and was not to be
moved. She felt very much annoyed, but Randolph
offered her a way of yielding gracefully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Oh, let the beggar come,” he said. “He will be
good fun. I want to see how he will behave.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Since you wish it, Randolph,” said Mrs. Briggs,
addressing herself pointedly to her son, “I will
make no further objection. It is your party, and
you ought to have your own way. But I shouldn’t
think it was necessary for you to call on the boy.
He is at some cheap boarding-house, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cheap, but perfectly respectable,” said Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to see what a cheap boarding-house is
like,” said Randolph; and his mother said no more.</p>

<p class='c010'>At eight o’clock the servant brought up to Gilbert’s
room a card bearing the name of Randolph Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a young gentleman that wants to see you,”
she explained.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go down and bring him up,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>He hurried downstairs, and found Randolph waiting
in the parlor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to see you, Randolph,” he said
cordially; “will you stay here, or come up to my
room?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I would like to see your room,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It isn’t much to see,” said Gilbert; “but I shall
be glad to have you come up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a long way down-town,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All the better for me. I am nearer my place of
business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert’s room was on the third floor, back. He
opened the door and invited Randolph in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a small place!” exclaimed Randolph,
looking around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So it is,” said Gilbert; “but I make it do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the furniture is extremely common,” remarked
his visitor, critically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true also,” said Gilbert, laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There does not seem to be much of it either; you
have but one chair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take that, if you please, and I will sit on the
bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph sat down, but not till he had examined
the chair carefully to see if it was clean.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see how you can live in such a place,”
remarked the young aristocrat.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>“Oh, I easily accommodate myself to it,” said
Gilbert; “but I hope soon to make a change for the
better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; a young man in the house has a large room,
which he has agreed to share with me as soon as his
present room-mate leaves. That will probably be in a
week. Then I can offer you a better reception.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is the young man’s name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ingalls. I believe he comes from Massachusetts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he in business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; he is in a stationery store on William
Street. Of course, he is a new acquaintance, but I
think we shall get on well together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of boarders have you here?” asked
Randolph, curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Rather a miscellaneous class. The gentlemen
are chiefly in business. There is one public school-teacher—a
lady.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, there is nobody that moves in good
society?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“How much board do you pay?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six dollars!” repeated Randolph, turning up his
nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of the boarders pay considerably more, but
my room, as you see, is small, and that makes it low
for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a table have you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Plain, but as good as could be expected. Of
course it don’t compare with yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I find no fault with it. Everything is
served neatly, and that is what I care most about.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this point Mr. Ingalls knocked at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Excuse me,” he said, when he saw Randolph; “I
didn’t know you had company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in,” said Gilbert; “or rather, if your room-mate
is out, let us adjourn to your room. We shall
be more comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly; I shall be glad to have you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Randolph Briggs, Mr. Ingalls,” said Gilbert,
by way of introduction.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“I am glad to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Briggs,” said the young man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph bowed condescendingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>They went at once to the larger room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is much better,” said Randolph, who seemed
surprised to see a sofa.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I shall consider myself promoted when I
get here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you in business, Mr. Briggs?” asked Mr.
Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, I am preparing for college,” said Randolph;
“there is no need of my going into business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I could have gone to college,” said Gilbert,
regretfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It takes money to go to college,” said Randolph,
complacently; “I intend to live in style when I go
there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid, Gilbert,” said young Ingalls, “we
must put off going till our wages are raised.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must put it off forever,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have hopes of getting ready when I am fifty,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>said the young man; “perhaps Mr. Briggs will be a
professor at that time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t teach,” said Randolph, “though it is
very respectable to be a professor. I shall be a man
of fortune.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls glanced quietly at Gilbert. He was
evidently amused by the self-importance of the young
aristocrat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you like your place, Gilbert?” asked Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t got any ice-water here, have you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will go down and order some.”</p>

<p class='c010'>While Gilbert was gone, Randolph said, “I am
glad Gilbert has got a place, for he is poor and needs
it. My father has done a great deal for him; but
then he can afford it, for he is a rich man. I have
no friends in this neighborhood; but I thought I
would come down to see how he was getting along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert ought to be very grateful,” said Mr.
Ingalls, dryly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“I think so, too. It is not every poor boy who
has a rich man to help him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Gilbert re-entered with the water, and shortly
after Randolph left.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think of him, Mr. Ingalls?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He seems to think a good deal of himself,” said
the young man. “He referred to you in a very
patronizing way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“His mother has spoiled him,” he said; “she is
the most disagreeable woman I ever saw. If Randolph
had been brought up differently, he might not
show so much foolish pride. I like his father best of
the three.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert little suspected that the man whom he
praised had been, thus far in life, his worst enemy.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT CALLS ON THE VIVIANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>As</span> the boarders rose from the dinner-table on Friday,
Alphonso Jones addressed Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let us take a walk,” he proposed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Gilbert; “but I have an engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose there is a lady in the case,” said
Alphonso, slyly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is a young lady where I am going,” answered
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I thought. I suppose you wouldn’t be willing
to mention names?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes. I am going to call on Mr. Vivian, in
West Forty-eighth Street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Mr. Vivian, the great merchant?” asked
Jones, surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe he is an extensive importer.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>“That’s the one I mean. How in the world did
you get acquainted there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t been long acquainted,” said our hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso Jones was a young man who, in England,
would be called a tuft-hunter. He aspired to be on
visiting terms in families of high social position; but
thus far had not met with much success. This did
not prevent him from boasting continually of intimacy
in quarters where he was not even acquainted. He
did not dream that his little imposture was easily seen
through by most of those who knew him, but was
complacent in the thought that he was classed with
that aristocracy, which he admired from a distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you know the Vivians, Mr. Jones?” asked
Mr. Ingalls. “I thought you knew everybody that
was worth knowing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I do,” said Alphonso, with an air of importance,—“that
is, nearly everybody. I met the
Vivians, I believe, at Saratoga, but did not have a
chance to cultivate their acquaintance. Greyson,
will you do me a favor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Let me accompany you this evening to Mr.
Vivian’s. You can introduce me as your friend, in
case they do not remember our former meeting.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to oblige you, Mr. Jones,” said
Gilbert, “but my own acquaintance is too limited to
allow me to take such a liberty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just as you say, of course,” said Alphonso,
crestfallen. “I dare say I shall soon meet them at
some fashionable party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So it will really not make much difference,” suggested
Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, very little,” said Mr. Jones, nonchalantly. “I
thought perhaps Mr. Greyson might like the company
of one who was used to society. I think, on the
whole, I will call on my friends, the Montmorencys,
this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where do they live, Mr. Jones?” asked Mr.
Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They occupy an elegant mansion on Fifth
Avenue,” answered Alphonso, consequentially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Couldn’t you take me along with you?” asked
Mr. Ingalls, demurely.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“I fear not,” said Alphonso. “The fact is, Mr.
Ingalls, the Montmorencys are very exclusive, and
have expressly said to me more than once, ‘We are
always glad to have you drop in, Mr. Jones, for we
look upon you as one of ourselves; but bring no strangers.
Our circle is already extensive, and we cannot
add to it.’ Very sorry, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So am I, Mr. Jones,” said Mr. Ingalls. “I
should like to know a few high-toned people. How
fortunate you are in knowing so many! What is the
number of the Montmorencys’ house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always forget numbers,” said Alphonso, rather
confused (for the whole story of the Montmorencys
was a fiction), “but, of course, the house is familiar
to me. It’s on Murray Hill.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That fellow is a humbug, Gilbert,” said Ingalls,
as he and his room-mate entered their own apartment.
“He pretends to have a great many fashionable friends;
but it’s all a sham. Some day I’m going to teach
him a lesson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Introduce a friend of mine, a good amateur actor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>as a French count. Fancy his delight at making each
an aristocratic acquaintance!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me know when the time comes,” said Gilbert,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You shall assist me in it. I hope you will have
a pleasant call this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert dressed himself carefully, and at half-past
seven started on his visit. The evening was pleasant,
and he decided to walk. Just opposite the Hoffman
House he fell in with Randolph Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hallo, Gilbert,” called out Randolph, “where
are you bound,—to our house? I don’t believe you’ll
find anybody at home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am bound elsewhere,” said Gilbert</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?” asked Randolph, curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To Mr. Vivian’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To call upon Laura?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My call will not be exclusively upon her,” said
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take my advice and don’t go,” said Randolph
actuated by jealousy.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Why not?” Gilbert asked, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They might look upon it as an intrusion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think they will, as I was specially invited
for this evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Out of politeness. Probably they have forgotten
all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It appears to me, Randolph, that you take a good
deal of interest in this matter,” said Gilbert, amused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I care nothing about it; only as a friend I
thought I would just mention that it might be thought
rather presumptuous to take advantage of the accident
that made you acquainted with Laura, to force yourself
upon the family. If I were a poor boy like you,
I would be careful to associate with my own class.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was provoked at Randolph’s insolence, as he
rightly considered it, and answered coldly, “I will
think of your advice, Mr. Briggs. I appreciate your
motives in offering it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does he mean?” thought Randolph, following
with his eyes his father’s ward. “I believe the
fellow is angry with me. Poor and proud, I dare say.
The Vivians will soon get tired of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>But though he tried to console himself with this
reflection, it chafed Randolph not a little that Gilbert
should be invited to a house which he could not hope
to enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert kept on his way to Mr. Vivian’s house
arriving about eight o’clock.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mr. Vivian at home?” he inquired of the
servant who answered his summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He went out for half an hour; will you come in
and wait for him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Miss Laura in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe she is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you may hand her my card, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was ushered into the parlor. He did not
have to wait long. Laura entered and cordially
offered her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad to see you, Gilbert—Mr. Greyson,
I mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind about Mr. Greyson,” said Gilbert,
smiling. “Call me Gilbert, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will,” said Laura, frankly. “Do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>know, I already begin to look upon you as an old
friend.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad of that, Miss Laura.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father went out for half an hour, as the
servant probably told you. He bade me keep you till
his return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you; I shall be very glad to stay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I met a friend of yours on Fifth Avenue yesterday,
Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who was it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know how far he is my friend,” he said;
“though he told me this evening he was, and as a
friend he ventured to give me some advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed?” said Laura, looking the curiosity she
felt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you like to hear what it was?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I certainly should, for it doesn’t strike me that
Randolph Briggs is particularly qualified to give
advice to anybody.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He advised me not to come here.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Not to come here! Why not?” exclaimed
Laura, impetuously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He said I was only invited out of compliment,
and that my visit would probably be considered an
intrusion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder how he dared to say such things!” said
Laura, indignantly. “What can he know of our feelings?
Why, he isn’t on visiting terms here himself!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he meant it for my good,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you didn’t take his advice, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t care to deprive myself of a pleasure.
Besides, I thought I could soon judge for myself
whether you looked upon me as an intruder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think about it?” asked Laura.
“You have been here long enough to decide.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I will stay a little longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then a boy of ten opened the door of the
parlor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Laura,” he said, “mother wants you to bring
Mr. Greyson into the library.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A PLEASANT EVENING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> was presented to a pleasant-looking lady,
whom Laura introduced as her mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Greyson,” she said,
cordially; “I supposed Laura would bring you in
here at once, but it seemed to be her intention to
monopolize you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had important business to talk over,
mamma.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very important, no doubt. How do you like the
city, Mr. Greyson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I shall like it after I am better
acquainted,” Gilbert answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t introduced me, Laura,” said her
brother Fred, in an aggrieved tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert,” said Laura, “let me introduce to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>your favorable notice my brother Fred, who, in his
own opinion, is a model of all the virtues.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to meet him. I never saw a model boy
before,” said Gilbert, pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never pretended to be a model boy,” said Fred.
“Laura’s only chaffing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did you pick up that word, Fred?” said
his mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it a good word, mamma? It’s just what
she does.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fred has just commenced Latin,” said Laura,
“but I am afraid, from his own story, that it is just
wearing out his constitution.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see any good in it,” said Fred. “Do
you know Latin, Mr. Greyson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have studied it some.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far have you been?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have read Cæsar and Virgil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, then you know a lot about it. I’m only in
the second declension.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t like it, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Not much. I don’t see how anybody could ever
talk such stuff.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will be more interested in it as you get on
further. That was the way with me. I wasn’t in
love with it at first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Mr. Vivian entered, and greeted Gilbert
cordially.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told Laura to keep you,” he said. “What
have you been doing since we met?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have got a place, or rather Mr. Briggs got one
for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am with Mr. Sands, a stock-broker. His office
is on Wall Street.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know of him, though I don’t personally know
him. How do you like your new situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not been there long enough to decide. I
like Mr. Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you still an inmate of Mr. Briggs’ house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; I am boarding on Clinton Place, near
Broadway.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“You find that more convenient to your office?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you have fairly got started in your business
career. I hope you may be successful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe you told me that your money, of which
Mr. Briggs had charge, has been entirely expended on
your education?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you compelled, then, to live on your weekly
wages?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think I could do that very well, as they
only amount to five dollars a week. Mr. Briggs
offered to pay my board, and let me use this for
other expenses. I don’t like to have him do it,
but he insists upon it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That seems kind,” said Mr. Vivian. “Was it
your idea, or his, to go to a boarding-house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suspect,” said Gilbert, hesitating, for he was
not clear whether he ought to tell this, “that it was
Mrs. Briggs’ idea. From the first, she has not
seemed to like me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“I don’t like her looks,” said Laura; “I have seen
her several times. You know, papa, she was at the
same hotel with us at Saratoga. She looks cross.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must not speak too hastily against people,
Laura,” said Mrs. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suspect Laura only shares the general feeling,”
said Mr. Vivian. “Mrs. Briggs is, by no means, a
favorite in society.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor Randolph, either,” added Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought he was a beau of yours, Laura,” said
her father, slyly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He never was, papa. I used to meet him at
dancing-school, and I have danced with him there;
but that is the end of our acquaintance. If he bows
to me I bow back, but I don’t care to know any more
of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t we have a little music, Laura?” asked her
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only play a little. Do you play, Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Miss Laura.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Or sing?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“A little.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I’ll make a bargain; I will play if you
will sing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hardly feel prepared to sing in company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This isn’t company. You needn’t mind any of
us. Fred, open the folding-doors, will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The piano was in the parlor adjoining. The doors
were thrown open, and Laura sat down to the piano.
Two or three songs were selected, and Gilbert sang to
Laura’s accompaniment. He had a good voice, and a
correct ear, and the double performance passed off
smoothly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Doesn’t your brother sing?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fred? He don’t know one tune from another;
besides, he don’t like the piano. The hand-organ is
his favorite instrument.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean to buy one when I am rich enough,” said
Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shall you go around with it?” asked Laura; “or
only keep it in the parlor for the entertainment of
visitors?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may laugh as much as you like,” said Fred;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“but a hand-organ, that is, a good one, sounds splendid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever see such a barbarian? Gilbert,
what else do you sing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The evening slipped away almost before they were
aware. To Gilbert, it was positively delightful.
Not that he was in love with Laura, but, never having
had a sister, it was an agreeable novelty to him to
meet a young girl so frank and attractive as Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will come again soon, Mr. Greyson,”
said Mrs. Vivian, when our hero rose to take his leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, do come,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall consider it a privilege to call,” said Gilbert,
with sincerity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By the way,” said Mr. Vivian, “I have taken
several tickets for a concert in Steinway Hall next
Wednesday evening. I have a spare one for you, Mr.
Greyson, if you have no engagement.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be very glad to accept one, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then come up to dinner that evening; we dine at
six. We will all go together.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Am I to go?” asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“There will be a ticket for you, if you would like
to go, though I am afraid you won’t enjoy the classical
music you will hear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No matter,” said Fred, “I’ll go, though I’d
rather go to a circus.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If there were only a hand-organ, Fred would
enjoy it,” suggested Laura.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c010'>“Well, Gilbert, what sort of a time did you have?”
asked Mr. Ingalls, when his room-mate returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Delightful! I am going to dine there next
Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me you are making a favorable
impression in that quarter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A knock was heard at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in,” said Mr. Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Alphonso Jones opened the door and entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Excuse my late intrusion, gents,” he said.
“And how did you find the Vivians, Mr. Greyson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They are very high-toned people.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>“I presume so, but I am not much of a judge,”
said Gilbert</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably,” said Mr. Ingalls, “you do not know
as many of that class as Mr. Jones. Did you find
the Montmorencys well, Mr. Jones?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite so, thank you. Mrs. Montmorency has
had a bad cold; but she has quite recovered now.
They talk of going to Europe next summer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do they, indeed? How you will miss them!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To be sure. However, I have many other friends
in the first circles whom I can visit. I suppose,
Mr. Greyson, the Vivians have a fine house?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems very comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Montmorencys live in a perfect palace. I
wish you could see it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I could, Mr. Jones,” said Mr. Ingalls;
“but you wouldn’t take me, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I couldn’t, Mr. Ingalls, as I explained to you.
They are so very exclusive.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder visiting such fine houses doesn’t make
you dissatisfied with your own home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my tastes are very plain,” said Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some of your own poetry, Mr. Jones?” asked
Mr. Ingalls, demurely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it’s Shakespeare or Byron,” answered Jones;
“I forget which. Good-evening, gents.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would you like to know where Mr. Jones spent
the evening, Gilbert?” asked his room-mate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“On Fifth Avenue?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. Mr. Tarbox followed him, and saw him
enter a billiard-saloon on the Bowery. Jones is a
first-class humbug.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AT STEINWAY HALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Simon Moore</span>, the book-keeper in the broker’s
office where Gilbert was employed, was a young man,
somewhat under thirty. He understood his business
very well, and thus far had given satisfaction to Mr.
Sands. Personally, however, he was not agreeable.
He was irritable and exacting, and had not been liked
even by his cousin John, when the latter was office
boy. Now, however, that John had been discharged,
the book-keeper, as we have seen, made common cause
with him, and John came to look upon him as a
friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this Moore was not altogether disinterested.
John’s mother, who was his aunt, kept a boarding-house,
and found it difficult to meet her expenses.
John’s wages, though small, were important to her,
and now that she was deprived of this resource, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>nephew feared that he might be called on for assistance.
It was in order to save his own purse that he
desired to reinstate John in his old place. The
readiest method that occurred to him was to prejudice
Mr. Sands against Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going out this evening, cousin Simon?”
asked John, one evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may go out by and by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I go with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you want to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore was not always willing to be troubled
with his cousin, but this evening he chanced to be in
a pleasanter humor than usual.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have tickets to a concert, John,” he said.
“Would you like to go?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very much,” answered John, readily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The tickets were given me by a friend of mine,
who is on the ‘Times,’” explained Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is the concert, cousin Simon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At Steinway Hall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was, in fact, the same concert to which Gilbert
was invited by Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The book-keeper was not remarkable for his liberality,
and John had been not a little surprised at
receiving the invitation, until he learned that the
tickets had cost his cousin nothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Eight o’clock found them in their seats at Steinway
Hall. The concert did not commence punctually, and
they had some time to look about them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you see any one you know, cousin Simon,”
asked John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said the book-keeper, “I see a particular
friend of yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A particular friend of mine!” repeated John,
puzzled. “Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Five rows in front of this. There, near the
centre of the hall.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see any body I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is Gilbert Greyson, your successor in our
office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is he, I declare. He is talking to a pretty
girl beside him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That girl is the daughter of Mr. Vivian, the
great importer.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“You don’t say so. How on earth did he come to
know her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t say,” answered Moore, coldly. “He is
a very forward, pushing fellow. That may explain it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hate him,” said John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t love him overmuch myself,” said Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>John and his cousin were not the only acquaintances
who recognized Gilbert on that evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph and his mother sat two rows behind the
Vivians. Mr. Briggs had intended to come, but had
a headache. He had suggested that the extra
ticket be sent to Gilbert; but Mrs. Briggs had decisively
objected.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t care about having that boy seen with us
in Steinway Hall,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” asked Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t fancy him. Besides, he would be presuming
on our kindness.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he is the kind of boy to do that,”
said Mr. Briggs, who understood Gilbert much better
than his wife. “It is a pity the ticket should not be
used.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“If it were in a different part of the house, away
from our seats, I should not care particularly,” said
Mrs. Briggs. “If he went with us, he might be
thought to be a near relative.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think he would do us any discredit,
either in appearance or in manners,” said her husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are simply infatuated with that boy, Mr.
Briggs. I am sure Randolph doesn’t want his
company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Like mother, like son,” thought Mr. Briggs; but
for the sake of peace he did not think it best to press
the matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon after Randolph and his mother took their
seats, the former discovered Gilbert sitting nearly in
front of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s here, after all, mother,” he exclaimed, in a
low voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is here, Randolph?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert Greyson. Don’t you see him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s with the Vivians, too!” ejaculated Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Briggs, unpleasantly surprised. “That boy doesn’t
appear to have a particle of shame.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He needn’t be ashamed of his company. I wish
I were in his place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mean that. He probably hinted to Mr.
Vivian to take him, and he couldn’t very well refuse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very likely,” said Randolph. “He’s got plenty
of cheek.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Both mother and son could see that Gilbert and
Laura Vivian were conversing pleasantly, judging
from the smiles on the faces of each.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. and Mrs. Vivian are not very wise in permitting
such an intimacy between their daughter and
a penniless boy,” said Mrs. Briggs, frowning. “Some
people are very unwise.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dare say he pretends he is rich, and boasts of
father’s being his guardian,” suggested Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dare say you are correct,” said Mrs. Briggs.
“If I knew Mrs. Vivian, I would correct that wrong
impression.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here the music commenced, and the two were silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph cared very little for the music, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>was too classical to suit his taste. He did not expect
to like it, but he went because he knew that the audience
would be a fashionable one, and he liked to be
seen on such occasions. Gilbert had more musical
taste, and appreciated the greater part of what he had
heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the concert was over, he thanked Mr. Vivian
cordially for the invitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have had a very pleasant evening, thanks to
you, sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you have enjoyed it,” said Mr. Vivian,
kindly. “Come and see us soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just after this parting, Gilbert fell in with Mrs.
Briggs and Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Mrs. Briggs,” he said, politely.
“Good-evening, Randolph. Where were you sitting?
I did not see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We saw you,” said Randolph. “You were
nearly in front of us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did Mr. Vivian invite you to come?” asked Mrs.
Briggs, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are making the most of your chance meeting
with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was something unpleasant in her tone, and
Gilbert detected it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have been very kind and polite to me,” he
answered, in a reserved tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would not advise you to presume upon it too
far,” continued Mrs. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t intend to, madam,” said Gilbert, stiffly.
“I don’t think I have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seemed very attentive to Laura,” said Randolph,
with a characteristic sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was my duty to be polite,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time they had reached the street, and Gilbert
said “Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Neither Mrs. Briggs nor Randolph invited him to
call, though the fact that Mr. Briggs was still his
guardian would have made such an invitation only an
act of ordinary politeness.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he made his way toward Fourth Avenue, Gilbert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>brushed against Simon Moore and John; but
having his mind occupied, he did not notice them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There he goes!” said John, enviously. “I wish
I had as much cheek as that fellow has.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve got a fair amount, John,” said his cousin,
drily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know it,” said John, aggrieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, John,” said the book-keeper, with
unwonted good-humor. “Suppose we go in somewhere
and have oysters. I feel hungry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So do I,” said John, briskly. “I know a bully
place near by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If it’s a good place, you can lead me there.
While we are discussing the oysters, I have a little
plan to tell you about, that may give you back your
place at our office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good!” said John. “You’re a true friend,
cousin Simon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ten minutes later they were sitting in a curtained
compartment, in a saloon famous for the excellence of
its oysters.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>In the next compartment, two minutes previous,
Mr. Sands, the broker, had taken his seat and given
his order; but of this neither John nor his cousin had
the slightest suspicion.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A PLOT AGAINST GILBERT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> next day Mr. Sands received an unexpected
summons to Washington. A brother, who was clerk
in one of the departments, was seriously ill, and he
was summoned to his bedside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long shall you be absent, sir?” inquired
Simon Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot say; it will depend on how I find my
brother. Keep me apprised of what is going on by
letter, and, if necessary, by telegraph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” said Simon, cheerfully; “you may
rely upon me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone to the post-office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have sometimes thought, Mr. Moore, that you
were prejudiced against the boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“I was at first, sir,” said Moore; “but on the
whole he seems faithful, and disposed to do his duty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands smiled slightly, but this Mr. Moore did
not observe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think well of him myself,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he does well, he won’t have reason to complain
of me,” said the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Mr. Sands smiled, but said nothing. Just
as he was leaving the office for the cars, Gilbert
returned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish, Gilbert, you would accompany me to the
Courtland Street Ferry,” said his employer. “I am
going to Washington this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, sir!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am summoned to my brother’s sick-bed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did you hear of his sickness, sir?” asked
Gilbert, in a sympathizing tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A week since; but last evening I learned by a
telegram that he is dangerously sick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By this time they were on their way to the ferry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may take my valise, Gilbert,” said the broker,
“if you are willing.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Certainly, sir,” said Gilbert, politely. “I hope
you will find your brother better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I certainly hope so. He would be a great loss to
his family. By the way, how are you getting on with
Mr. Moore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hardly know, sir,” said Gilbert. “I don’t
think he likes me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you done anything to offend him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that I am aware of. I have always treated
him with respect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is right. If you get into any trouble with
him while I am away, come to me after I return, and
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked surprised, but of course promised to
do so.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall try not to get into any disturbance,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you won’t, but I fancy you will,” said his
employer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you don’t think I am quarrelsome, Mr.
Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, that is not my reason. I will say no more at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>present, except to request you, if anything happens, to
give me a truthful and detailed account of it when I
return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir, I will,” said Gilbert, who, though
puzzled, felt that his employer was friendly towards
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert waited till the boat started, and then returned
to the office. He regretted Mr. Sands’ absence,
for something told him that Mr. Moore would
make it very disagreeable for him while he was gone.
Indeed, the book-keeper was not long in showing his
state of feeling towards our hero. As Gilbert entered,
he looked up sharply from his desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you are back at last?” he said unpleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you intended to remain away all day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sands desired me to go to the ferry with
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t desire you to stop to play on the way
home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you see me playing on the way home?”
demanded Gilbert, provoked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“How could I when I was at work in the office?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has any one reported to you that I stopped to
play?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then why do you charge me with it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here, young man, I advise you not to try
any of your impudence on me!” said Simon Moore,
who, knowing himself in the wrong, was all the more
angry. “I tell you, once for all, that I won’t stand
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t intend to be impudent, Mr. Moore; but I do
expect decent treatment from you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are showing your hand pretty quick, young
man. No sooner does Mr. Sands leave the city than
you begin to put on your airs. I shall take care to
report your conduct to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have neither done nor said anything that I am
ashamed to have reported to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shut up!” said Moore, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert saw that there was no use in prolonging the
dispute, and quietly went about his duties. While he
was absent on an errand, a little later, his predecessor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>John, looked in the door, and, seeing his cousin alone,
entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, cousin Simon,” he said. “Where
is Mr. Sands?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gone to Washington.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has? How long will he be gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A week perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s favorable for us, isn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore nodded significantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right there,” he said. “When he gets
back, Gilbert Greyson won’t be here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll do what we were talking about last evening?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I shall have plenty of chances while Sands is
away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t you manage it to-day?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, it would look suspicious; I don’t want Mr.
Sands to suspect anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How soon, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say day after to-morrow. In order to avert suspicion,
I will in my letter of to-morrow speak a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>word for Gilbert,—say he’s doing better than I anticipated,
or something of that sort. The next day the
explosion will come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll bounce Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I’ll take that upon myself, and explain to
Sands when he returns. Ten to one he won’t interfere
then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you’ll take me in Gilbert’s place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I’ll do that, too. But you must do better
than you did last time. The fact is, John, you were
lazy and careless. I was sorry to have you go, as
you are my cousin; but I couldn’t blame Mr. Sands
much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’ll turn over a new leaf, cousin Simon,” said
John, readily. “You shan’t have anything to complain
of.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Gilbert returned from his errand, and the conversation
necessarily closed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert nodded politely to John, though he took no
particular fancy to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So the boss is away?” said John, sociably.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“Yes, he has been called away.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you are glad of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should I be?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the cat’s away, the mice can play, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This mouse does not care about playing,” said
Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert is a model boy,” said Simon Moore, with
a sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never set up for one,” said John, in a tone of
congratulation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say not,” sneered the book-keeper, who
could not abstain from criticising even his cousin, in
whose favor he was intriguing to oust Gilbert from his
position. “However, I’ll say this for you, that you
are not a hypocrite.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I never want to be,” said John, virtuously.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course Gilbert understood that here was another
hit at him; but he was discreet enough to understand
that it would do him no good to notice it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently John turned to go.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“Is there anything I can do for you, cousin
Simon?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not to-day,” answered the book-keeper, significantly.
“You can look round again in a day or
two.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As John left the office, a small boot-black approached
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shine yer boots?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get out of my way!” said John, crossly, at the
same time lifting his foot and kicking the boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you do that for?” said the boy, angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I pleased.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then take that;” and the knight of the brush
swiftly touched John’s cheek with the dirty brush,
leaving a black mark upon his assailant’s cheek.</p>

<p class='c010'>John would have renewed the attack, but a chorus
of laughter at his appearance drove him back into the
office to wash off the black mark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll wring his neck when I get a chance,” muttered
John, angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“He wouldn’t have touched you, if you had let him
alone,” said Gilbert. “Why did you kick him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I pleased. Mind your business, or I
may kick you, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better not,” said Gilbert, quietly.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE PLOT SUCCEEDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>The</span> third day was rainy, and Gilbert wore a thin
overcoat, which, on arriving at the office, he took off
and hung up. At ten o’clock the rain ceased, and he
did not feel the need of wearing it when sent out on
errands.</p>

<p class='c010'>About eleven o’clock John sauntered into the
office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may go round to the post-office, Gilbert,”
said the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert put on his coat and went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t it about time, cousin Simon?” asked John,
significantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How shall we manage?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The book-keeper took from his pocket a ten-dollar
bill, and handed it to John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is Gilbert’s coat,” he said. “Put this bill
into one of the pockets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John obeyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess that will fix him,” he said, in a tone of
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll manage the rest,” said the book-keeper.
“Stay round here till Gilbert gets back, and we’ll
bring matters to a crisis.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just as John was placing the bill in Gilbert’s coat-pocket,
the little boot-black mentioned at the close of
the last chapter thrust his head into the doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shine yer boots?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Clear out, you vagabond!” said the book-keeper,
irritably.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom, for that was his name, looked inquisitively
about him and retired. He saw that there was no
chance for business. He recognized John as the one
who had kicked him the day before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder what he was putting into the coat,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>thought; but dismissed the thought as not concerning
him till afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he notice what I was doing?” thought John,
with momentary uneasiness. “But, of course, he
wouldn’t understand,” he felt, with quick relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few minutes elapsed, and Gilbert returned, bringing
home the mail.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right!” said Moore, “wait a minute, and I
shall want to send you out again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, by the way, Gilbert,” he said, after a moment’s
pause, “have you seen anything of a ten-dollar
bill?—I laid one on the desk an hour ago, and
now it has disappeared.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I haven’t seen it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you look on the floor? It may have
dropped.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert searched, but of course unsuccessfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is strange,” said the book-keeper. “I remember
distinctly placing the bill on the desk; have
you seen it, John?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, cousin Simon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is very mysterious,” mused the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>“I hope you don’t suspect me of taking it, cousin
Simon,” said John, who had been instructed what to
say.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John began to turn his pockets inside out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want you to search me,” he said; “if you
don’t, you may think I took it, after all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never thought of such a thing, John,” said
Simon Moore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure Gilbert and I would prefer to be
searched,” persisted John, looking towards Gilbert as
he spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert colored, for it was not agreeable to him to
fall under suspicion, but he answered quietly, “I am
quite ready to be searched.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think it at all necessary,” said Simon
Moore; “but if you boys insist upon it, I will do it.
It is certainly strange that the bill should have disappeared,
and left no trace behind. Gilbert, will you
search John, and then he shall search you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you desire it, Mr. Moore,” said Gilbert; “but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>I don’t believe John took the bill, and I am sure I
didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert proceeded to search John, the latter assisting
him. A jack-knife, a couple of keys, a handkerchief,
and twenty-five cents in money were all that he
found.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not very rich,” said John, smiling. “I don’t
mind saying that the ten dollars would be very acceptable,
but I haven’t got it; are you satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Gilbert, “you haven’t got it, and I
didn’t think you had; you may search me now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John conducted the search carelessly, for he knew,
beforehand, what the result would be.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t find it,” he said. “Where can the bill
be? Are you sure you didn’t put it back into
your own pocket, cousin Simon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quite sure. By the way, Gilbert, didn’t you
wear an overcoat?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; there it is, hanging up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“John, you had better examine that also, that the
search may be thorough.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Certainly,” said Gilbert, little dreaming of what
was in store for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>John plunged his hand into one pocket and found
nothing; then into the other, and drew out the ten-dollar
bill.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s this?” he asked, pretending to be surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me see it,” said Gilbert, overcome with surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let <i>me</i> see it,” said Simon Moore, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a ten-dollar bill,” said John, looking at it
more closely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the note I missed,” said the book-keeper,
taking it into his hands. “What have you to say to
this, Greyson?” he demanded, sternly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have this to say,” said Gilbert, a little pale, as
was natural, “that I don’t know anything about that
bill, or how it came in my coat-pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose not,” sneered the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am willing to swear to it,” said Gilbert, recovering
his firmness.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“A boy that steals money cannot expect to be
believed, even upon oath,” said the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you believe I took that money, John?” asked
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mustn’t ask me,” said John. “I didn’t
think you’d do such a thing, Gilbert, but it looks
mighty suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never stole a penny in my life,” said Gilbert,
hotly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you claim this money as yours?” asked the
book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then how came it in your pocket? It couldn’t
have got there without hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A light dawned upon Gilbert’s mind; a suspicion
of the truth flashed upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true,” he said, significantly. “Somebody
must have put it into my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And that somebody was yourself,” said Moore,
sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course it was,” chimed in John.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Gilbert looked slowly from one to the other. There
was something in their faces that revealed all to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I understand,” he said. “You two have
formed a conspiracy to ruin me. I see it now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you speak in that way again,” said Moore, in a
rage, “I will kick you out of the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to have you refer the matter to Mr.
Sands,” said Gilbert, betraying no alarm. “He will
do me justice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to refer the matter to the nearest policeman,”
said the book-keeper, in a menacing tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do so, if you like,” said Gilbert, though he
shrank with natural reluctance from being arrested,
innocent as he knew himself to be. “I am not without
powerful friends, as you will find.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t have him arrested, cousin Simon,” said
John, with apparent compassion. “He has given up
the money. Discharge him, and let him go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was what Simon Moore had already determined
to do. He knew very well that in any legal
investigation John and he would incur suspicion, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>for prudential reasons he preferred not to court any
such publicity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to arrest you,” he said, turning to Gilbert;
“but I will have pity on your youth, hoping that this
will be your last offence. I shall, of course, discharge
you, since I should not be justified in retaining you
under the circumstances. I will report to Mr. Sands
why I was compelled to dispense with your services.
I will pay you your wages up to to-day, and you need
not come here again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t trouble yourself about that, Mr. Moore,”
said Gilbert, with dignity. “I shall report to Mr.
Sands when he returns, and abide by his judgment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You had better not,” said Moore. “I advise you
for your own good. Mr. Sands will still have it in his
power to arrest you; your best course will be to leave
the city, and go to some place where you are not
known.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall remain in the city, and can be found, if
wanted,” said Gilbert, boldly. “The day will come,
Mr. Moore, when my innocence will be known by all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“I have heard such things before,” he said. “You
can go. John, I will employ you, temporarily, in
Gilbert’s place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand your object now, Mr. Moore,” said
Gilbert, looking significantly at John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Begone, or I will yet have you arrested,” said the
book-keeper, angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert put on his coat and hat, and walked out of
the office.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN HUMBLE FRIEND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Just</span> outside the office from which he had been discharged,
Gilbert was accosted by Tom, the boot-black.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shine yer boots?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only five cents, mister,—that’s half price.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s cheap enough,” said Gilbert; “but I’ve just
lost my place, and I cannot afford to pay even that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Been bounced?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert hesitated. He did not like to admit that he
had been suspected of dishonesty; still he was innocent,
and had nothing to be ashamed of in the matter. He
accordingly related what had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom whistled.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Did you say the money was found in your
pocket?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the pocket of my overcoat,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And was your coat hanging up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I know how the money got there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know how the money got into my pocket!”
repeated Gilbert, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, the other boy put it there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What other boy,—the boy that’s in the office?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, his name is John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you happen to see him do it?” asked
Gilbert, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I went to the door to see if the book-keeper didn’t
want a shine; just as I was looking in, I see that
boy John go to a coat, and put a bill into the
pocket. I thought it was his coat, and wondered
what made him keep his money loose in that way. Did
he say you put it there?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wanted you bounced—that’s what’s the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“You are right; he wanted the place himself, and
now he’s got it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just you go back and tell the book-keeper all
about it, and I’ll stand by you,” suggested Tom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t do,” he said. “John is Mr. Moore’s
cousin, and I feel sure they are both in the plot;
they would say you were lying.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let ’em say it,” said Tom. “I’ll punch their
heads if they do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert smiled at the zeal of his humble friend. “I
am afraid that would do neither of us any good,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you do nothin’, then?” asked Tom, disappointed.
“Will you stay bounced?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, till Mr. Sands comes back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he the boss?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; he is now in Washington, and may not return
for several days. When he comes back, I shall
want you to tell him all you saw.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll do it,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“What is your name? Where can I find you if I
want you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hang out at the Newsboys’ Lodge. My name
is Tom Connor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Tom; I’m very glad I met you.
Your testimony will be valuable to me. Don’t say
anything about it to anybody else at present. I want
to surprise them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I will have a shine, after all,” said Gilbert,
wishing to repay his new friend by a little patronage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll make your boots shine so you can see your
face in ’em,” said Tom, dropping on his knees, and
proceeding to his task energetically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will save me the expense of a looking-glass,”
said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So it will,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the last was completed, Gilbert drew ten
cents from his pocket, and extended it towards Tom,
but to his surprise the bootblack did not offer to
take it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind,” said he, “I don’t want no pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“Why not? You have earned it,” said Gilbert,
wondering at the refusal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re bounced, and aint got no money to spare.
I’ll wait till you’ve got your place again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind,” said Gilbert, grateful for the
considerate sympathy of his humble present; “but I
am not so badly off as some, for I have no board to
pay. You’d better take the money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll take five cents,” said Tom; “that’ll be
enough. I’d rather work for you for nothin’ than for
that other feller for full price.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t like him, then? Did he ever employ
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He kicked me yesterday; but I got even with
him,” he added, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you get even with him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I blacked his face for him,” said Tom, brandishing
the brush.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He didn’t fancy that, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He had to go back and wash his face,” said Tom,
laughing at the recollection.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Well, Tom, good-by,” said Gilbert, preparing to
go. “I’ll hunt you up when Mr. Sands gets back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll find me round here somewheres; this is
where I stand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert walked away, feeling considerably more
cheerful and hopeful than before his interview with
Tom. Now he felt that he had at hand the means of
his vindication, and his idleness would only be temporary.
He was shocked at the meanness and wickedness
of John and the book-keeper in forming such a conspiracy
against him. He was already learning the
lesson of distrust, and that is never a pleasant lesson
for any of us. Fortunately, we need not distrust
everybody. He must be indeed unfortunate who does
not find some true friends to keep up his faith in
humanity. Our hero had found one, who, though but
a boot-black, was likely to be of essential service to
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is said that ill news travels fast. That very
evening Mrs. Briggs learned that Gilbert had lost his
situation, and from what cause. It happened in this
way.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Randolph, chancing to be down-town, it occurred to
him to call upon Gilbert. His call was made about
half an hour after Gilbert had been discharged.</p>

<p class='c010'>He entered the office, and, looking about, saw John,
who appeared to be employed. He asked, in some
surprise, “Does not Gilbert Greyson work here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered John promptly, “not now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was discharged this morning. Can I do anything
for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Discharged!” exclaimed Randolph, much surprised.
“What was he discharged for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Simon Moore took part in the conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you a friend of Gilbert Greyson?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye-es,” answered Randolph, in a tone of hesitation.
“That is, he’s an acquaintance of mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you feel interested in him, I have unpleasant
news for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph pricked up his ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has happened?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“To be brief, I am afraid your friend is not strictly
honest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say so!” exclaimed Randolph, really
amazed. “He hasn’t run off with any money, has
he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He isn’t very much interested in him,” the book-keeper
said to himself shrewdly. “He doesn’t say
anything in his defence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; but I am afraid he would if the theft had not
been detected so soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What was it,—money?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A ten-dollar bill, which I laid casually on the
desk, suddenly disappeared. It was found, after a
little search, in the pocket of your friend’s coat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He isn’t my friend; he is only an acquaintance,”
said Randolph. “I don’t know much about him. I
didn’t think he’d steal, though. Did he own up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not he; he was too brazen. Mr. Sands was
absent from the city, but I did not hesitate to discharge
him at once. In our business a boy must
often be trusted with sums of value, and I should not
feel safe in continuing to employ him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“I suppose you’re right,” said Randolph. “I
wonder what father’ll say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I guess I’ll be going,” he continued. “I
didn’t expect to hear such news of Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We regret it very much,” said the book-keeper,
hypocritically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course,” said Randolph. “Serves him right.
He shouldn’t have made such a fool of himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That fellow don’t care much about Gilbert, John,”
said Simon Moore, after Randolph’s departure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so,” said John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he has no warmer friends than that, we shan’t
have any applications to take him back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not,” said John. “What do you think
Mr. Sands will say when he finds me here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I tell him you have done your duty, and done
all I required, he’ll probably keep you. You must
do better than you did last time. No fooling away
your time in the streets when you are sent on an
errand. It won’t do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There won’t be any trouble about me,” said John,
confidently.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A DOMESTIC DISCUSSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Randolph</span> hurried home to tell his mother what
he had heard about Gilbert’s loss of employment.
He knew well enough her feeling towards his father’s
ward to feel sure that it would be welcome intelligence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Detected in stealing money!” ejaculated Mrs.
Briggs, triumphantly. “Just what I predicted all
along. I am not often deceived about character.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never heard you predict it, mother,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was only because I did not like to speak
against the boy,” said Mrs. Briggs, only slightly discomfited.
“I read it in his face the first day he
came here. I saw he was sly and underhanded.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I didn’t,” said Randolph, who was less
malignant than his mother. “I never thought he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>would do such a thing. I didn’t like him, of course,
but still I thought he was honest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have lived longer in the world than you, Randolph,”
said Mrs. Briggs, sagaciously, “and I know
that appearances are deceitful. I am not so easily
taken in as your father. He has been infatuated
about this disreputable boy. I hope the knowledge of
the boy’s baseness will cure him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose we needn’t invite Gilbert to my party,
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, of course not,” said Mrs. Briggs, with
emphasis. “It would be an insult to you to invite a
boy convicted of theft.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father may insist upon it,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not unless he is bereft of his senses,” said Mrs.
Briggs. “He has made a point of it till now; but,
of course, this will change his wishes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph did not reply; but, notwithstanding his
mother’s assurance, he felt some doubts on the subject.
His father was, in general, yielding and easily
managed; but, as is often the case with such men, he
was, at times, unexpectedly firm.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>This conversation took place just before dinner. It
was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Briggs, who
went upstairs at once to prepare for dinner. Fifteen
minutes later they met around the dinner-table. By
arrangement with Randolph, Mrs. Briggs had reserved
to herself the pleasure of imparting to her
husband the news she had heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard some news to-day, Mr. Briggs,” she
commenced, in a premonitory tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed, my dear! Pleasant news, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think it will be pleasant to you, though, I
must confess, it is only what I have all along anticipated.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You speak in enigmas, Mrs. Briggs. Will you
kindly be a little more explicit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are aware, Mr. Briggs, that I have always
had a very unfavorable opinion of your protegé, the
Greyson boy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You certainly have not concealed your opinion of
him,” said her husband, shrugging his shoulders.
“Yes, I may say that I know your opinion of
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“I suppose you call it prejudice,” continued the
lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it certainly seems like it, not being founded
on the knowledge of anything to his detriment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That was not necessary. There is such a thing
as reading character. I judged him by his face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He seems to me to have a very frank, attractive
face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As you read it,” said his wife, contemptuously.
“Well, this paragon of yours has lost his place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has?” inquired Mr. Briggs, in evident surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, he has, and I am not surprised to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you know why he was discharged?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was detected in theft—stealing a large sum
of money!” answered Mrs. Briggs, triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>She expected that her husband would be overwhelmed
at this disclosure; but he asked quite
calmly, “How do you know this? Who is your
informant?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Randolph.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“What do you know of this, Randolph?” asked his
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph gave his father an account of his visit to
the office of Mr. Sands, and the information given
him there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you say to that?” demanded Mrs.
Briggs, in exultation. “Does that change your
opinion of your paragon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think there is some mistake somewhere,” said
Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why should there be any mistake?” she asked.
“Do you think Randolph would tell a lie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There are other ways of accounting for the mistake.
I have no idea that Gilbert is guilty of what is
charged against him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, this is absurd. You are perfectly infatuated
with this boy,” said Mrs. Briggs, angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mistakes have occurred before,” said her husband,
with provoking calmness. “I will investigate the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see what investigation is needed. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>boy has stolen the money. The book-keeper told
Randolph so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The book-keeper may be mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not much chance of that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Or he may have taken the money himself and
charged it upon Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, Mr. Briggs you are very perverse,” said
his wife, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I am not ready to believe Gilbert a thief
before he is proved so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“After he has been proved so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There would be no need of trials or juries if you
were a judge, my dear,” said Mr. Briggs, smiling.
“You would be for sentencing the unfortunate defendant
as soon as the charge had been brought
against him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cherish your delusion as to the boy’s innocence
as much as you like, Mr. Briggs; but there is one
thing which you will certainly concede.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert Greyson must not be invited to Randolph’s
party.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A common thief—impossible!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But suppose he is wrongfully accused?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is enough that he is accused, and probably
guilty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will investigate the matter, Mrs. Briggs. If I
am convinced that the boy is innocent, he shall be
invited.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs was about to make an indignant protest,
when the servant, who had answered the door-bell,
opened the door and ushered in the innocent cause of
the heated discussion,—Gilbert Greyson.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A FEMALE FOE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a moment of embarrassing silence after
the entrance of Gilbert. Mrs. Briggs, as she afterwards
expressed it, was paralyzed with astonishment
at the effrontery of the boy. Randolph waited with
curiosity to hear what his parents would say, while
Mr. Briggs was silent merely because he was taken by
surprise. He was the first to speak, and his tone,
though a little embarrassed, was yet not without kindness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Gilbert,” he said. “Won’t you
sit down and have some dinner?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs looked daggers at her husband. How
could he dream of extending such an invitation to
Gilbert, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you,” said Gilbert, “I have already
dined.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Then take a seat. We shall soon be through
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is an unusual time to call,” said Mrs.
Briggs frigidly, breaking silence for the first time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What difference does it make?” interposed her
husband. “Gilbert is not a stranger, to stand on ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So it appears,” returned his wife, in the same
unpleasant tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to apologize for calling during your dinner-hour,”
said Gilbert, “but I wished particularly to
consult you about my affairs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Of course this was addressed to Mr. Briggs. Mrs.
Briggs was perhaps the last person in the range of his
acquaintance whom our hero would have cared to
consult.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything new with you?” asked his guardian,
in a tone of slight embarrassment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Gilbert, frankly; “I am in
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs glanced meaningly at Randolph, as if
to say, “Now it’s coming.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“You would perhaps wish to speak to me alone,”
said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, if you have any secrets, Randolph and I can
withdraw,” said Mrs. Briggs, with unnecessary offence.
She would have been deeply disappointed to
be excluded from the conference between Gilbert and
her husband. Our hero, however, relieved her of her
apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Though I am in trouble,” he said, “I have nothing
to be ashamed of, and am perfectly willing to
speak before all of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs here glanced at his wife with a relieved
air. Gilbert spoke as if confident of his own innocence.
It produced no such effect on Mrs. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s going to brazen it out,” she said to herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go on, then,” said Mr. Briggs, kindly. “What is
your trouble?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have been charged with theft, and dismissed
from my situation,” said Gilbert, candidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you call that nothing to be ashamed of?”
demanded Mrs. Briggs, sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Gilbert met her hostile gaze with unflinching calmness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said, “it is nothing for me to be ashamed
of, for the charge is false.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What evidence have we of that except your own
assertion?” demanded Mrs. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is enough for me,” said Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is not enough for me,” said his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will give you an account of the affair so far as
I understand it,” said Gilbert. “Fortunately, I have
a witness who is able to confirm my words.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert’s statement need not be repeated, as the
facts are already known to us.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you expect us to believe the testimony of this
boot-black.” said Mrs. Briggs, scornfully,—“a highly
respectable witness indeed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose a boot-black may speak the truth,
madam,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I dare say he would say whatever he was instructed
to say for twenty-five cents, perhaps less.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are determined to believe me guilty, Mrs.
Briggs,” said Gilbert, quietly, betraying no anger;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“I expected it, for I knew you are prejudiced against
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I certainly don’t believe the very extraordinary
story you have told us,” retorted the lady. “You
charge a book-keeper, of high standing, with entering
into a conspiracy against you. It is absurd upon its
face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know the book-keeper is of high
standing?” asked Mr. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because Mr. Sands would not have any other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert has the same guaranty of high standing,”
said her husband, smiling. “He has been employed
by Mr. Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is different. He took him upon your recommendation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would I be likely to recommend any boy not of
high standing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your levity seems to be ill-timed, Mr. Briggs,”
said his wife, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought it my duty to come to you and tell you
at once,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Knowing that you could not conceal it from us,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>for we knew it already,” said Mrs. Briggs, who could
not forbear another sneer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You knew it already!” exclaimed Gilbert, with
unmistakable astonishment  “Has Mr. Moore already
sent you word of it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; Randolph happened to call at the office for
you just after your discharge. He brought us the
news.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am much obliged to Randolph for his call,”
said Gilbert; “I am only sorry that it occurred at
such an unfortunate time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was unfortunate for you, no doubt,” said Mrs.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I return there, I hope you will call again,”
said our hero, turning to Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs was exasperated by our hero’s coolness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you the effrontery to fancy you will be
taken back after such a crime?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have committed no crime, Mrs. Briggs. The
charge is false, as I shall prove to Mr. Sands when he
returns from Washington. He is a just man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>understands that the book-keeper is prejudiced against
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When will Mr. Sands return?” asked Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a few days. He has gone to the sick-bed of
his brother. I shall wait till he returns before taking
any steps to clear myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is probably your best course. I hope all will
come out right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it will,” said Gilbert. “Now, let me bid
you good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not stay the evening?” said Mr. Briggs, in
a friendly tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you very much, but I will wait till I am
cleared of this charge. I came up to-night because I
wanted you to know about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will accompany you to the door,” said Mr.
Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>When they were in the hall, he said, “Next
Wednesday Randolph is to have a birthday party. I
shall be glad to see you here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, gratefully. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>thank you all the more, because it shows that you
believe in my innocence. But all the same, I would
rather not accept. I shall still be resting under this
false charge, and Mrs. Briggs evidently believes me
guilty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Women are apt to be prejudiced,” said Mr.
Briggs, apologetically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still the prejudice would make it unpleasant for
me to come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you are right, Gilbert. At any rate,
you are manly and independent, and I respect you
for it. Come round to my office if anything turns up
in which you need my advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Mr. Briggs returned to the dining-room, his
wife accosted him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you had a secret conference with your
promising protegé,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not secret. I am willing to tell you all that
passed between us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“I invited Gilbert to attend Randolph’s party next
Wednesday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good heavens! Mr. Briggs,” exclaimed the lady,
angrily, “this is a little too much. Of course the
boy snapped at it. He has more effrontery than any
boy I ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He declined the invitation,” said Mr. Briggs.
“He said that while resting under this charge he was
unwilling to be present on such an occasion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then he has more decency than I gave him
credit for,” said Mrs. Briggs, relieved. “Knowing
his guilt, he would find it embarrassing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Permit me to differ with you, Mrs. Briggs. One
thing more. I have only given Gilbert a verbal invitation.
Let me request you to send him a personal
invitation with the rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What necessity is there for that? Has he not
declined to come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He must receive a formal invitation, nevertheless,”
said her husband, sternly, “or there shall be no
party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your father is so infatuated with that boy,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>said Mrs. Briggs, after her husband had left the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>But she sent the invitation. She knew by her
husband’s tone that he was fully in earnest. She was
still a little afraid that Gilbert would accept, and was
only quite freed from apprehension when she received
a note from him regretting that he could not be
present.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>Would</span> you like a little fun this evening, Gilbert?”
asked his room-mate, on the succeeding
morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Gilbert; “I always enjoy fun, and
especially now when I have lost my place, since it
will help me to forget my bad luck. Is there anything
up?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; we are going to play a practical joke on
Alphonso Jones. We are going to gratify his taste
for associating with the aristocracy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your plan?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have discovered in Bleecker Street a stylish
barber, who has a smattering of French. In feet, he
has served me more than once. He has entered into
our plot, and agreed to personate a French count—the
Count de Montmorency.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Good!” said Gilbert, laughing. “When are the
two to be brought together?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This very evening, in our room. I shall despatch
a note to Mr. Jones during the day, inviting
him to meet my illustrious visitor. Hayward and
Kennedy are in the secret, and will be present also.
Of course you will be with us, but you must keep on
a straight face.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never fear for me,” said Gilbert. “I will take
care not to let the cat out of the bag.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In conformity with the plan, Mr. Alphonso Jones
received, during the day, the following note:—</p>

<p class='c016'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Jones</span>,—I shall be glad if you will
favor me with your company this evening, in my
room. I have been fortunate enough to make the
acquaintance of an illustrious French nobleman,
Count Ernest de Montmorency, who, in the most condescending
manner, has accepted an invitation to
spend this evening with me. You will find him very
affable and agreeable, notwithstanding his superiority
in social rank. I feel a little diffident about receiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>him, not being so well up in the usages of fashionable
society as you are—I rely on you to help me
out. I have invited Hayward and Kennedy also to
be present. Greyson will, of course, be with us.
If you have any other engagement, break it for my
sake.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yours truly,</p>
<p class='c018'>“<span class='sc'>W. Ingalls</span>.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The face of Jones was overspread with smiles as he
read this epistle, and he felt at least a foot taller.
He could conceive of nothing more glorious than to
be introduced to a foreign nobleman. Once in his
life it had been his privilege to make the acquaintance
of a brigadier-general, who had given him two
fingers to shake, and said, “I am glad to meet you,
sir.” Most of the fashionable acquaintances of whom
he boasted had no existence save in his imagination,
but this general was a reality; he was only a general
of volunteers, but that made no difference to Alphonso;
he had managed hundreds of times to make
capital of his greatness in some such way as this:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“My friend, General Smith, remarked to me one
day;” or, “Speaking of brave men reminds me of my
intimate friend, General Smith.” But even General
Smith was not for a moment to be compared to the
Count Ernest de Montmorency; there was something
peculiarly high-toned in the name, Alphonso thought.
So thought Mr. Ingalls, or he would have invented
some other.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso was anxious to communicate to some one
else the honor in store for him; he would like to have
gone to his employer at once, and said, “Mr. Simpson,
I am to meet the Count de Montmorency this evening.”
This, however, even to Alphonso, seemed rather
an abrupt and uncalled-for announcement, and he had
to consider how best to manage the matter, for he was
determined that Mr. Simpson should know it. It was
not entirely easy, but finally a bright and satisfactory
idea dawned upon the happy Jones.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went up to the desk, behind which his employer,
a stout, practical man of business, was sitting, and
coughed by the way of arresting his attention.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Eh, Mr. Jones, did you wish to speak to me?”
inquired Mr. Simpson.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” said Alphonso; “would you be kind
enough to let me leave the store half an hour earlier
than usual?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you have a good reason, Mr. Jones; are you
sick?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir, my health is excellent, thank you. The
fact is, sir, I have an invitation to meet the noble
count, Count Ernest de Montmorency, this evening,
and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The—what?” exclaimed his employer, arching
his brows.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A French nobleman, sir—the Count Ernest de
Montmorency,” repeated Alphonso, trying not to betray
too strongly his inward exultation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What time are you going to meet him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This evening, sir, but I wish time to dress properly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I don’t know that I have any objection,”
said the merchant, deliberately. “Where is this
count stopping?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“I don’t know exactly, sir; but probably at the
Brevoort House or the Clarendon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, you can go. Business is not pressing,
and you can be spared. But, hark you, Mr. Jones,
one word of advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If this count wants to borrow money of you,
don’t lend him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure he wouldn’t ask such a thing,” said
Alphonso, shocked at the idea. “Why, he possesses
a beautiful chateau and an immense estate in France!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here Alphonso drew upon his imagination for what
he considered to be probable enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They all say so,” said the practical Simpson,
“even when they haven’t twenty-five cents to bless
themselves with. My advice may be needed, after
all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso was rather disgusted by this caution,
which seemed so derogatory to the character and position
of a nobleman; but he, after some reflection,
attributed it to Mr. Simpson’s disappointment in not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>himself enjoying the privilege of being invited to meet
the count.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Kidder,” he said to a fellow-clerk, “what
do you think of my necktie?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It looks well enough—why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was wondering whether it would do to wear this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s up this evening?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am invited to meet the Count Ernest de Montmorency,
as you will see by this note.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Strange Ingalls didn’t invite me,” said Kidder.
“When did he pick up the count?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, Mr. Kidder, that is a singular way
of speaking,—<i>picking up</i> the count,” protested
Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no great respect for French counts,” said
Kidder. “They don’t generally amount to much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s jealous, too,” said Alphonso to himself,
complacently. “It is clear he envies me my invitation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think I ought to wear, Mr. Kidder?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Dress suit and white tie, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I think. I’m really sorry I can’t take you
with me, Kidder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I couldn’t go to-night. I’ve got a ticket to
the theatre.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d rather meet the count than go to forty
theatres,” thought Alphonso. “Wouldn’t it be a
splendid thing if he should take a fancy to me, and
invite me to visit him at his chateau in <i>la belle
France</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso made so many mistakes during the
remainder of the day that he might have been spared
considerably sooner without detriment to the business.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>COUNT ERNEST DE MONTMORENCY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>At</span> eight o’clock Alphonso knocked at the door of
Mr. Ingalls’ room. He was got up with the utmost
magnificence which he could command. With his
dress-coat, white tie, and imitation diamond pin, he
made an imposing appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to see you, Mr. Jones,” said Mr.
Ingalls. “Count Ernest de Montmorency, permit me
to introduce my friend, Mr. Alphonso Jones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The count, a little man, with a waxed mustache
of extraordinary size, a long nose, and pale, watery
eyes, rose, and bowed profoundly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am most happy, Monsieur Jones, to have ze
honor of making your acquaintance,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My lord count, the honor is on my side,” returned
Alphonso, with an elaborate bow, which he
had learned in dancing-school.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“Mr. Jones,” said Ingalls, “will you take the
chair next to the count? Our distinguished friend is
desirous of making some inquiries about fashionable
society in America.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be most happy,” replied Alphonso, immensely
flattered, “to give the noble count any
information in my power.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand from Monsieur Ingalls you do go
much in society,” said the count.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A little, your lordship,” said Mr. Jones, modestly.
“I am intimate in some of our leading families.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have some fine watering-places, <i>n’est ce
pas</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my lord count,—Newport, Saratoga, and
Long Branch are all fashionable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have visit zem all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes,” answered Alphonso, who had once
stopped over night at Saratoga, and made a day’s excursion
to Long Branch. “I meet so many of my fashionable
friends there, that it is very pleasant for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Sans doute</i>, and which do you prefare?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Saratoga, my lord count. It is the most high-toned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in my opinion. My friends, the Vernons, of
Madison avenue, always go there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I once did know a Marquis de Vernon in my own
country.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A relation of my friends,” said Alphonso, confidently.
“How long has your lordship been in
America?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tree week, zat is all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you been in New York all the time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Monsieur Jones, I did visit Boston and Philadelphia,
but New York is one fine city, ze best of
all; it reminds me of Paris.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Paris is a very beautiful city, I have always
heard, my lord count.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, <i>très magnifique</i>. Zere is no city like it.
Have you visited Paris, Monsieur Alphonse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He is getting intimate, thought Mr. Jones, elated,
or he would not call me by my first name.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, your lordship, I have not had that great
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you come,” said the count, affably, “you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>must come to my chateau in Normandy, and stay one
month.”</p>

<p class='c010'>This was beyond Alphonso’s most sanguine hopes.
To be invited to visit a foreign nobleman at his
chateau was an unlooked-for honor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You overwhelm me with your kindness, my lord
count,” said Alphonso, in a flutter of delight. “I
hope some day to accept your honorable invitation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you will have zer good time. My sister,
the Countess Marie de Montmorency, will be charmed
to see you. She adores Americans.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso was in the seventh heaven of delight.
Instantly he pictured the high-born Countess Marie
falling in love with him, marrying him, and thus giving
him a place in the aristocratic circles of France.
Perhaps, in that case, family influence would procure
him a title also. It was the happiest moment of his
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing would delight me more than to make the
acquaintance of your august family, my lord count,”
he said, his voice partly tremulous with joy. “When
do you propose to return to <i>la belle France</i>?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“What, you do speak my language, Monsieur
Alphonse?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only a little, your lordship,” said Mr. Jones,
modestly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Oui, monsieur, un peu.</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Comment vous portez vous, Monsieur Alphonse?</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Très beaucoup bien</i>,” answered Alphonso,
proudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What an accent!” exclaimed the count, raising
both hands. “You do speak like one native.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I should soon learn it if I were in <i>la
belle France</i>,” said Alphonso, much pleased.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Ingalls, “I don’t like to
interrupt you, but permit me to offer you a glass of
wine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Glasses were handed to the company.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Jones, will you propose the count’s health?”
asked the host. Alphonso rose, and placed one hand
on his heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gentlemen,” he commenced, “I feel—ahem!
deeply honored, and—and happy on this auspicious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>occasion. We are assembled, sir, to do honor to an
illustrious peer of the realm. The noble Count
Ernest de Montmorency honors us with his high-toned
presence. We all hope that he may enjoy his visit,
and return in safety to his aristocratic relations, his
honorable mother, and his sister, the noble Countess
Marie de Montmorency. I propose the health of the
noble count.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The toast was drunk with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Jones, you are quite an orator,” said Mr.
Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have ze great talent for speaking Monsieur
Alphonse. You should go to Congress.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My lord count, you flatter me,” said Mr. Jones,
deciding that this was, by all odds, the proudest
moment of his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all, Mr. Jones,” said Mr. Ingalls. “I
never heard a neater speech, did you, Hayward?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never,” said Hayward.</p>

<p class='c010'>So poor Alphonso was fooled to the top of his bent,
and when the company separated, and he retired to
his humble apartment, he was visited by the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>ravishing dreams, in which he stood at the altar with
the high-born Countess Marie de Montmorency, clad
in sumptuous attire, wearing on his breast the cross of
the Legion of Honor.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE LITTLE FLOWER-GIRL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> found it very irksome to be without employment;
besides, he was anxious to be vindicated as
soon as possible from the malicious charge which had
been made against him. He felt himself fortunate,
however, in one respect; he was subjected to no privations,
having his board and lodging paid by his
guardian. Had Mr. Briggs suspected him, he was
proud enough to have left his boarding-place, and
relied upon his own exertions.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the force of habit, and partly to fill up his
time, Gilbert continued to go down-town daily. One
day he met Mr. Vivian on Broadway, below the
Astor House.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Gilbert,” said the merchant,
pleasantly. “Are you out on business?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“No, sir,” answered Gilbert. “I am out of
business just at present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you were in the office of a stock-broker.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I was; but I have lost my place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Through no fault of your own, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. I should not have lost my place if Mr.
Sands had been in the city. During his absence the
book-keeper, who has a dislike to me because I
superseded his cousin, discharged me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come up this evening to my house, Gilbert.
Then I shall be at leisure, and you can tell me all
the details of the affair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure he won’t credit the charge against me,”
thought Gilbert, and this thought encouraged him not
a little.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert continued his walk. As he was passing
Trinity church-yard, he was accosted by a little girl,
of perhaps eight years old. “Won’t you buy some
flowers, sir?—only five cents.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert shook his head mechanically. Then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>glanced at the little girl, and his sympathy was
aroused. She was poorly dressed, with a fragile
figure, and thin, pale face, which yet only lacked the
roundness and rosy hue of health to be uncommonly
pretty. She did not repeat her request, but she looked
sad and depressed. Gilbert paused and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you sold many flowers to-day, little girl?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; only three bunches,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where do you get them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sell them for a woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much does she give you for selling them?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two cents a bunch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you have only made six cents to-day. How
long have you been standing here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ever since eight o’clock,” said the little girl,
wearily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you get tired being on your feet so long?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t care for that if the people would only
buy my flowers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are young to be sent out in this way.
Haven’t you got a father to take care of you?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Papa used to take care of me when he was well,
and did not let me come out; but now he is sick, and
we have no money, and I have to leave him,” said the
little girl, sadly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Poor child!” said Gilbert, compassionately.
“You are unfortunate. Where does your father
live?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“On Pearl Street, in a tenement house,” said the
little flower-girl; “but I am afraid we will be turned
out because we cannot pay the rent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Emma Talbot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, Emma, if you like, I will go around and
see your father with you. Perhaps I can help him,
or get some of my friends to help him. Can you
come now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I have sold this bunch of flowers, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As it is the last you have got, I will take it; so
we needn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, thank you, sir,” said the child, brightening
up. “If you won’t mind, I will stop and buy a roll
at the baker’s for papa.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“Certainly, Emma. I have plenty of time.
Wait; take my hand while we cross the street, you
must be careful, or you may be run over.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wait for the policeman generally,” said the
little girl. “I should be afraid to cross alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are quite right to be careful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little girl took his hand confidingly, and
together they crossed the City Hall Park. It was a
new sensation to Gilbert to have the charge of a little
girl. He had always been thrown among boys, and,
never having had a sister, was very ignorant of girls,
and the tastes of girls. For the first time, as he
held Emma’s hand, it occurred to him that he would
like to have a little sister, whom he could pet and
protect.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he was crossing the Park, he met his successor,
John, sauntering along at a snail’s pace. John had
been sent out on an errand, but had fallen into his old
way of loitering and wasting the time which belonged
to his employer. When he caught sight of Gilbert
he started in surprise at his young companion.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“Hallo, Greyson!” he said, by way of opening a
conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning,” said Gilbert, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that your sister?” asked John, looking hard
at Emma.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered Gilbert, shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ho, ho!” laughed John. “I understand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve got a place as a girl’s nurse. That’s
good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very witty,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much wages do you get?” continued John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I had better not tell you, or you might
get up a conspiracy to deprive me of my position.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean by that?” asked John, uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know well enough what I mean. You know
that you got your present place by dishonorable
means. But I don’t think you’ll keep it long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better take care what you say,” blustered
John. “My cousin may have you arrested yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is quite at liberty to do so,” answered Gilbert,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>unterrified. “I don’t think he will find it prudent
though.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because it might come out who really put the
money in my coat-pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are mistaken. I have found out who did
put it in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you need any information on that
point.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Look here,” said John, angrily, “you’d better
not tell any lies to Mr. Sands when he comes back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no occasion to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better leave the city, or Mr. Sands may
have you arrested.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will risk that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess you can get a place in Philadelphia,”
said John. “I’ll get my cousin to give you a recommendation
if you’ll promise to go there.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can he recommend me after discharging me
for theft?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“He’ll think this will be a lesson to you. Shall I
ask him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, thank you. I don’t intend to leave the city
at present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid that chap will make trouble for me
yet,” muttered John to himself, as Gilbert walked
away with the little girl; “but he can’t prove anything.
I guess me and cousin Simon will be more
than a match for him.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>EMMA’S FATHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> kept on his way with the little girl.
After a short walk, she paused in front of a miserable
tenement house on Pearl Street.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is where we live,” she said; “will you go
upstairs, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you think I shall not be intruding on your
father,” said Gilbert, with instinctive delicacy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will be glad to see a kind face,” said Emma,
simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then if you will lead the way, I will follow,”
said our hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>They clambered up three flights of stairs, and then
Emma opened a door and ushered her companion into
a small, barely furnished room. On a pallet on the
floor was stretched a man of fifty, pale and emaciated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with eyes preternaturally bright; his face was
turned towards the wall, and he did not see Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that you, Emma?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, papa; how do you feel now?” asked the
little girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Much the same, my child; did you sell your
flowers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, papa, and I have brought you a fresh roll.
I have brought some one with me, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Talbot turned his head, and looked at Gilbert,
not without surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you won’t look upon me as an intruder,
sir,” said Gilbert; “your little girl told me you
would not, or I would not have ventured to call.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad to see you,” said the sick man,
“though this is but a poor place to receive company
in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand your situation, sir,” said Gilbert;
“you have been sick and unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right; I was unfortunate first, and sick
afterwards. Emma, will you give the young gentleman
a chair?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Oh, don’t trouble yourself,” said Gilbert, taking
a chair for himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Talbot proceeded: “Five years since, I removed
to Chicago, with my little girl, in the hope
that in that growing and prosperous Western city I
might, at least, earn a comfortable living. I was not
wholly without means,—I had about a thousand dollars,—but
misfortune pursued me. I was once burnt
out, lost my situation by the failure of the firm that
employed me, and the end of it all was, that a year
ago I found myself bankrupt. Then I decided to
come to New York, hoping to succeed better here. I
managed, while I was well, to earn a precarious living
by copying for lawyers (I am a book-keeper by vocation)
but, a month since, I was stricken down by a
fever, from which I am only just recovering. How
we have got along I can hardly tell you. When I
became sick I had but a dollar in my pocket-book,
yet we have continued to live. My little Emma,” he
continued, looking proudly at the little girl, “has
been a great help to me. She has managed to earn a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>little, and has attended upon me by night and by day.
I don’t know what I could have done without her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to work for you now, papa,” said the
child, simply; “all my life you have been working
for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is a perfect little woman, though only ten
years old,” said the father. “Poor child! her life
has been far from bright. I hope the future has
some happier days in store for both of us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only get well, sir,” said Gilbert, cheerfully,
“and the happier days will begin.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope so; but even in health I found it hard to
get along.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At this moment there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Emma went to the door, and opened it.</p>

<p class='c010'>A short, stout, coarse-featured woman entered, and
looked about her with the air of one who had come to
engage in battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take a seat, Mrs. Flanders,” said the sick man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Much obliged to you, sir,” said the woman, not
to be placated by this politeness; “but I can’t stop.
I come on business. I suppose you know what it is.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“I suppose it is the rent,” said Mr. Talbot,
uneasily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is the rent,” said Mrs. Flanders. “I hope
you are ready to pay it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can you expect it, Mrs. Flanders? You
know how long I have been sick and unable to earn
anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is not my fault, Mr. Talbot,” said the
woman, sharply. “I’m a widow woman, and have
to look out for myself. When I let you this room, I
told you you must pay me prompt, for I had to pay
prompt. Have you forgot that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I have not forgotten it, and I am very sorry
that circumstances have been so against me. Wait
patiently, and I will pay you yet.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait patiently!” repeated the woman, angrily.
“Haven’t I been waiting patiently for a month? To-morrow
I have to pay my rent, and I must be paid
what you owe me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We have but a few cents in the house,” said Mr.
Talbot. “How much have you got, Emma?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four cents, papa.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Give them to Mrs. Flanders; it is all we have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four cents!” exclaimed the landlady, shrilly;
“do you mean to insult me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel much like insulting anybody,” said
Mr. Talbot, wearily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Once more, do you intend to pay me my rent or
not?” demanded the virago.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t at present. In time—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stuff and nonsense!—then out you budge to-day.
I can’t afford to keep you here for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“O Mrs. Flanders,” pleaded Emma, in terror.
“It will kill my father to go out, sick as he is. Let
us stay here a little longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It won’t do,” said the woman; “I’m not so
soft as that comes to. If you won’t pay the rent,
you must budge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert had listened to this dialogue with mingled
pain and indignation. It was his first practical
acquaintance with poverty and the world’s inhumanity.
He could remain silent no longer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much is your bill, madam?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“Rent for four weeks, at a dollar a week,—four
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will pay it,” said Gilbert, glad that the amount
was not beyond his resources.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little girl impulsively seized his hand and carried
it to her lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, how kind you are!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure it will not inconvenience you?”
asked Mr. Talbot.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will accept the loan with thanks. You
are a friend in need.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The landlady took the money with avidity, for she
had considered the debt a bad one.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, young man,” she said; adding, in an
apologetic tone, “You may think me hard, but I
have to be. I have to live myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert listened coldly, for he was disgusted with
the woman’s coarse and brutal manners.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I hope you’ll get well soon, sir,” she said,
turning to Mr. Talbot; but he did not answer her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the way of the world,” he remarked, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Mrs. Flanders had gone out. “Poverty has few
friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When you are well, sir, I will mention you to a
friend who may give you some work,” said Gilbert.
“Meanwhile I will call again in a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will always be welcome,” said Mr. Talbot,
gratefully. “You have done me a great service.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gilbert went out, he realized that his generosity
might cause him inconvenience, for he had but a
dollar remaining in his pocket-book, and was earning
nothing.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT IN A TIGHT PLACE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> called upon the Vivians the same evening.
He was received with as much cordiality as on
his first visit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now,” said Mr. Vivian, laying down the evening
paper, which he had been reading at Gilbert’s
entrance, “tell me how you came to lose your place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert told his story in the fewest possible words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a great shame,” said Fred, indignantly; “I’d
like to put a head on that book-keeper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sympathize with you, Fred,” said Laura; “but
I think you might have expressed yourself differently.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your sister is right, Fred,” said Mr. Vivian;
“you must not be too ready to employ street
phrases.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what I mean, any way,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“Do you think your employer will do you justice
when he returns?” asked Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. Mr. Sands is an excellent man, and he
knows very well that Mr. Moore is prejudiced
against me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you expect to be taken back?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If anything should occur to prevent, come at
once and let me know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Before the evening was over Gilbert managed to
introduce the subject of the little flower-girl whom he
had befriended. He gave an account of the father’s
sickness, and the little girl’s devotion. Fred and
Laura were much interested, and asked many questions,
which Gilbert answered as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think these people really worthy of assistance,
Gilbert?” asked Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, I have no doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know there are many impostors, who live by
working on the sympathies of the benevolent?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir; but in this case I have no hesitation at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>all. I am sure Mr. Talbot and the little girl deserve
help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In that case,” said the merchant, “I am willing
to do something for them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew from his pocket a ten-dollar bill and
handed it to Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be best,” he suggested, “not to give them
this money all at once, but a dollar or two at a time,
in order to insure its careful use.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, joyfully; “this
money will be like a fortune to them. I will see that
your wishes are carried out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Papa,” said Fred, “may I give Gilbert my five-dollar
gold piece for the little girl and her father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at present, Fred; though I am glad you feel
like offering it. When this money is expended, Gilbert
will let us know, and then we will see what else
is to be done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a dear, good boy, to offer the money,”
said Laura, giving her brother an unexpected kiss;
“you have got a good heart, though you don’t always
keep your face and hands clean.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“A fellow can’t be always washing his face and
hands,” said Fred. “You needn’t kiss me if you are
afraid of the dirt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Laura laughed. “I will risk it this time,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Won’t you play me a game of checkers, Gilbert?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What am I to do while you two are playing?”
asked Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, you can be umpire,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should be sure to decide against you,” said
Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s because you like Gilbert,” said Fred, who
was just at the age when a boy is apt to make disconcerting
speeches.</p>

<p class='c010'>Laura blushed a little, and so did Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we both like him,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you both,” said Gilbert. “I suppose
there isn’t such a thing as three playing a game of
checkers. That would bring us all in.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>“No,” said Laura; “but we can play the Mansion
of Happiness, if Fred is willing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mind,” said Fred. “That’s good fun,
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So the game referred to was brought out, and an
hour was consumed in this way. Fred, to his great
delight, was the victor each time, and was disposed to
exult over his vanquished opponents.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Never mind, Fred; it will be our turn next
time,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>At half-past nine Gilbert set out for home. He
felt that he had passed a pleasant evening, and was
cheered by the thought that his discharge had not
alienated these true friends from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two days later he went into the office of Mr.
Briggs. He was accustomed to make a weekly call,
when Mr. Briggs would give him money to pay his
week’s board.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is Mr. Briggs in?” he asked, after looking about
him in vain for that gentleman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Briggs will not be in for a long time,” said
the clerk addressed. “He has gone to Europe.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Gone to Europe!” exclaimed Gilbert, in genuine
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Business of importance called him very suddenly,”
said the clerk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long is he to be gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is uncertain. From two to three months, I
should say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he leave any letter or message for me,—Gilbert
Greyson?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The clerk shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing at all,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert left the office in great perplexity. How
was he to pay the week’s board now due, he asked
himself, with less than a dollar in hand, and no income?</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE COUNT’S SECRET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>On</span> the morning after Alphonso Jones had enjoyed
his memorable interview with the Count Ernest de
Montmorency, he bore himself in a loftier and more
consciously superior manner than usual. He felt that
he was entitled to a larger measure of consideration,
on account of his intimacy with one of the nobility.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The count must have seen something in me, or
he would not have invited me to visit him at his
chateau,” reflected Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was natural that Mr. Jones should wish his
friends to be aware of his social distinction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Mr. Kidder,” he said, in a patronizing
manner, to his fellow-clerk. “How did you
enjoy the theatre last evening?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well. The play was a good one, and well
performed.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“I also passed the evening in a very agreeable
manner,” remarked Alphonso, complacently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where were you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In Mr. Ingalls’ room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, I forgot. What company did he have
in? Didn’t you say something of a French count
being expected?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Count Ernest de Montmorency was present,”
said Alphonso, dwelling with unction on the high-sounding
syllables.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you like him?” asked Kidder, who had
received a brief note from Mr. Ingalls, letting him
into the secret.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never met a more high-toned gentleman,” said
Mr. Jones, enthusiastically. “His manners were
most courtly, and I may add that he was very affable
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ingalls ought to have invited me,” said Mr. Kidder,
affecting to feel slighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will doubtless remember you another time,”
said Alphonso; “probably the count does not like a
large company.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“I suppose he is just like other men,” said Kidder,
by way of drawing out his fellow-clerk. “If you
hadn’t known him to be a count, you wouldn’t have
seen anything particular in him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I beg to differ with you,” said Alphonso, with an
air of superior information. “<i>Some</i> persons might
have thought so; but I claim to be a judge of
men, and I at once saw that he was a high-toned
aristocrat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What did you judge from, now?” asked Kidder,
amused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot explain what,—it was that the French call
<i>je ne sais quoi</i>,” answered Mr. Jones, who had been
studying up some French phrases that very morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<i>Genesee squaw!</i>” echoed Kidder, purposely
misunderstanding him. “What on earth has a
French count to do with a Genesee squaw?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pity your ignorance, Mr. Kidder,” said Alphonso,
mildly. “The words I used were French,
and mean, ‘I don’t know what.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t know what they mean? Then why do
you use them?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>“You misunderstand me again. <i>Je ne sais quoi</i>
means I—do—not—know—what. Do you see it
now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, that’s it. I didn’t know you were such a
French scholar, Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am a poor French scholar,” said Alphonso,
modestly; “but I shall try to make myself familiar
with the language before I go to France.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to France? How long has that
been in your mind?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To tell the truth, Mr. Kidder, I never thought
seriously of it till last evening. But since the Count
de Montmorency has been kind enough to invite me
to visit him at his chateau, and become acquainted
with his noble family, I feel that it is quite worth my
while to prepare myself to converse with them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say so! What a lucky fellow you
are! Did the count really invite you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He invited me in the most affable and friendly—I
may say urgent manner,” said Alphonso, complacently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Couldn’t you get me an invitation, too?” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Kidder, in pretended anxiety. “I’ve been long wanting
to go abroad, and I think my father would consent,
if I received such an invitation as that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to oblige you, Mr. Kidder, but
really I couldn’t venture on such a liberty,” said
Alphonso, decidedly; for he feared that his fellow-clerk,
who was better-looking than himself, might
interfere with his matrimonial designs upon the
count’s high-born sister.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps the count will invite me himself. I’ll
get Ingalls to introduce me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Possibly,” said Alphonso, coldly; “but I wouldn’t
obtrude myself upon his lordship.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see why I shouldn’t be introduced as well
as you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso, who privately considered himself more
high-toned than Kidder, felt that there was good
reason, but did not think it policy to pursue the
subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>Probably Mr. Jones referred to the Count Ernest
de Montmorency at least thirty times that day, and
succeeded in arousing the curiosity and envy of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of his acquaintances as were not in the secret. He
indulged in many a gorgeous day-dream, in which he
figured as the brother-in-law of the count, with a
beautiful chateau of his own, and this continued for
several days. But his dreams were destined to a rude
awakening.</p>

<p class='c010'>One evening, in passing through Bleeker Street,
Mr. Jones strolled into a barber shop, which he had
never before entered. He glanced carelessly about
him, when he made a sudden start, and gasped for
breath. There, behind a barber’s chair, in the act of
shaving a red-headed man, was the elegant Count
Ernest de Montmorency!</p>

<p class='c010'>The count looked up and met Alphonso’s astonished
gaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, M. Alphonse,” he said, with a
nod and a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening,” ejaculated Alphonso, with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c010'>How could he say “my lord count” to a barber?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you the—the—gentleman I met at the
room of my friend, Mr. Ingalls?” asked Mr. Jones.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“The same. I will explain hereafter,” said the
count, mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso succeeded the red-headed man in the
chair presided over by the count.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am incognito,” said the latter, in a low voice.
“I have been reduced to poverty by the rascality
of a relative. They don’t know me here in the
shop.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say so!” ejaculated Mr. Jones, much
impressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They think I am a common man. It would not
do to tell them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does Mr. Ingalls know?” asked Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, he knows how I am reduced; but he does
not respect me the less. May I rely upon your
secrecy, also?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly, my lord—I mean, sir,” said Mr.
Jones, beginning to think it was all right again.
“Do you think you will ever recover your estates?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t speak so loud! Yes, I am almost sure of
it. In that case, I shall expect you to visit me at
my chateau.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“Thank you. I shall be most happy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How strange it seems to be shaved by a count!”
thought Alphonso. “But I really wish he wasn’t a
barber. Couldn’t he get something else to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is your friend, the Count de Montmorency,
Mr. Jones?” asked Mr. Kidder, the next morning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe he is well,” said Alphonso, shortly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>HARD UP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>A street</span> boy, accustomed to live from hand to
mouth, would not have been disconcerted on finding
himself in Gilbert’s circumstances. But this was our
hero’s first experience of debt which he was unable to
pay, and it troubled him. He felt embarrassed at the
dinner-table, knowing that he was eating a meal for
which he had not the means of paying; and this
thought not only interfered with his appetite, but
made him unusually silent and reserved. His room-mate
noticed this, and spoke of it when they had gone
up to their room together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What made you so quiet, Gilbert?” he asked.
“You scarcely uttered a word at the dinner-table.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The fact is, Mr. Ingalls, I am in trouble,” answered
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“About your loss of place? You told me about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>that, and that you expected to get it back when your
employer returned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I do; but there is another trouble.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Troubles never come singly, they say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to be true in my case. I am owing for
a week’s board, and don’t know where I shall get the
money to pay it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought your guardian paid your board,” said
Ingalls, who was acquainted with the particulars of
Gilbert’s history.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So he did; but he has sailed for Europe suddenly,
without making any provision for the payment of my
money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long is he to be gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two or three months, they told me at the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is rather inconvenient. If you were only a
few years older, there would be a remedy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What remedy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You could marry Miss Brintnall. Mrs. White
told me the other day that Miss Brintnall has saved
up two or three thousand dollars from her earnings.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“That will be convenient for you when she becomes
Mrs. Ingalls,” said Gilbert, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think I would sacrifice myself for that
paltry sum?” demanded Ingalls, with much indignation.
“Ten thousand dollars is the lowest sum for
which I will sacrifice my liberty. I’ll tell you who
is most likely to become Miss Brintnall’s husband,
that is, if she consents.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alphonso Jones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alphonso lacks money to back up his gentility.
He only gets twelve dollars a week, Kidder tells me,
though he claims to have a thousand dollars a year.
Miss Brintnall’s fortune will be a great inducement
to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You forget that he has hopes of an alliance with
the sister of the Count de Montmorency.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he had better take Miss Brintnall,” said
Mr. Ingalls, dryly. “Now, to come back to your
affairs. Are you quite out of money?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Almost. I gave four dollars to a poor family a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>day or two since, not expecting that I was to be left
this way. I have about fifty cents in my pocket-book,
and I owe a week’s board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His room-mate reflected a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I were richer, for your sake, Gilbert,” he
said. “As it is, I can lend you money enough to pay
this week’s board bill. Before another week comes
round, something may turn up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Gilbert, gratefully; “but I
don’t like to rob you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t rob me, for I intend to let you repay
it when you can. If I could keep it up till your
guardian returns I would do so; but this I can’t do.
I will tell you what I would do in your case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would advise me, for I don’t know
what to do. I never was in such a situation before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was understood that your guardian would pay
your board for the present, was it not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. He offered to do it. I never would have
asked him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You say he left no directions at the office in regard
to it?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>“So the chief clerk told me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is clear, then, that it escaped his mind in the
hurry of an unexpected departure. Probably he will
set the matter right in his first letter. Wait a
minute, though. His wife and son probably accompanied
him to the steamer to see him off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very likely he spoke to them about it. I advise
you to call on them and inquire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked reluctant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be as you say,” said he; “but I don’t like
to speak to Mrs. Briggs on the subject. She dislikes
me, and so I think does Randolph, though not so
much as his mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you have told me; still I advise you to call,
the sooner the better, in my opinion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose I get no satisfaction?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In that case you will know what to look forward
to. If you are thrown upon your own resources, you
can lay your plans accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to know the worst, at any rate,”
said Gilbert, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“Then take my advice, and call this evening on
Mrs. Briggs.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will,” said Gilbert; “but I would rather have
a tooth out.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN UNSATISFACTORY CALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Mr. Ingalls</span> was right in his conjecture. On
board the steamer Mr. Briggs had thought of his
young ward, and was rather annoyed that he had not
left directions at the office that he should be paid his
regular weekly stipend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is one thing which I have forgotten,” he
said to his wife.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert has been in the habit of coming to me
every week for his board. I ought to have left directions
at the office with Seymour to pay him in my
place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He forgot that Mrs. Briggs was not aware of this
arrangement. She was not slow in expressing her
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“You don’t mean to say that that boy lived on
you!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I pay his board, if that is what you mean by
living on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is what it amounts to. Why permit this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely, you don’t expect that Gilbert will pay
all his expenses out of five dollars a week,” said her
husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why can’t he get along as well as other boys?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Other boys have no friends able to help them.
Gilbert’s father was my friend, and I mean to stand
by him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How much do you allow him for board?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six dollars a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can’t he get boarded cheaper?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me that six dollars is very cheap.
You remember that I spent a hundred dollars a week
for you and Randolph and myself at Saratoga one
season. That is about thirty-three dollars apiece.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is no resemblance in the two cases,” said
Mrs. Briggs, coldly. “Gilbert Greyson is only a
working-boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“And I am a working-man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t talk foolishly, Mr. Briggs,” said his wife,
sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have not much time to talk foolishly or otherwise.
Will you attend to this matter of Gilbert’s
board?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will attend to it,” said Mrs. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then there will be no need of my writing to the
office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, there will be no occasion to trouble yourself
further in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>On this assurance Mr. Briggs dismissed Gilbert
from his mind, and shortly afterwards bade good-by
to his wife and son.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I sometimes think your father is actually soft,”
said Mrs. Briggs to Randolph, on the way over the
ferry. “What claim has that Greyson boy upon him,
that he should squander six dollars a week upon him?
And that isn’t all, I presume. I have no doubt the
boy manages to coax extra money out of him almost
every week.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“He won’t get it out of you, mother,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say not,” said Mrs. Briggs, very emphatically.
“I should feel that I was robbing you.
If your father impoverishes himself by such ill-timed
liberality, you will be the sufferer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t think of that,” said Randolph, soberly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t, of course, wish to be mean or parsimonious,”
continued Mrs. Briggs, “but I hold that a
man’s first duty is to his own family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course it is,” said Randolph, who felt confident
of it now that he saw the bearing upon his own
interests.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you give Gilbert the six dollars a week?”
he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not unless he asks for it,” said Mrs. Briggs.
“If he doesn’t need it there will be no occasion to
offer it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he don’t ask for it, will you give it to me?”
asked Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have an allowance of five dollars a week
now. It seems to me that ought to be sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“I can’t save anything from it. If you give me
the six dollars beside, I’ll put some in the savings
bank.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will wait and see whether the boy calls for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope he won’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He probably will. He’ll take all he can get.
That is his nature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs quite misread Gilbert, as my readers
will probably judge; but she was too prejudiced to
judge him fairly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph was not as mean as his mother. He had
a little of his father’s nature, though he was more like
his mother. The thought that it would impair his
future inheritance did not much affect him, but the
prospect of having his allowance so largely increased
took away all consideration for Gilbert. He cared
very little whether our hero was able to pay his board
or not, if only the money might be paid to him. He
was very selfish certainly; but he loved money for
what it would buy, and not for its own sake, as was
the case with his mother. Of course he hoped that
Gilbert would not present himself at the house, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>make inquiry for the money; but in this he was
destined to be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sitting at the window on the evening Gilbert had
resolved to call, he saw, not without disappointment,
our hero mount the steps and ring the bell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s come, mother,” said he, in a tone of regret.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who has come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert Greyson. I suppose he has come for his
six dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he has,” said Mrs. Briggs, with a curl
of the lip. “I knew he wouldn’t keep away long.
Now, Randolph, one thing I ask,—don’t say a word
about the matter. I want to make him introduce the
subject himself. I don’t wish to spare him any embarrassment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, mother.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Directly the door opened, and Gilbert entered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Mrs. Briggs,” he said, approaching
and taking the lady’s hand. She just touched his
hand coldly, and withdrew hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening,” she said, briefly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“Good-evening, Randolph,” said Gilbert, turning
to the younger member of the party.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening,” said Randolph, less frigidly.
“Have you got a place yet?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet. My employer has not returned from
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably it will make very little difference to you
how long he stays,” said Mrs. Briggs, disagreeably.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope it will make considerable,” returned Gilbert.
“I was surprised to hear that Mr. Briggs had
gone to Europe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He went very suddenly,” said Randolph. “It
has put off my birthday party.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like to have seen him before he went,”
said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He had no time to notify all his acquaintances
that he was going,” said Mrs. Briggs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How long will he be gone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite uncertain,” said the lady, shortly.
“It will depend on his business, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish this visit were well over,” thought Gilbert,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>but he felt that he must introduce the matter which
led to his call.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did Mr. Briggs leave any message for me?” he
inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Any message for you?” repeated Mrs. Briggs,
arching her eyebrows. “Why should you expect
that he would leave any message for you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you are not aware,” said Gilbert, uncomfortably,
“that Mr. Briggs, while I am at work on
small wages, has been in the habit of paying my
board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indeed!” said Mrs. Briggs, in apparent surprise.
“Why should he do that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Out of friendship for my father, he told me,” said
Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should hardly have supposed that you would
request such a thing of one not related to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t request it,” said Gilbert, coloring.
“Mr. Briggs was kind enough to offer to do it. I
accepted, on condition that I might hereafter repay
him what money he should advance.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>“It is not very likely the money will ever be
repaid,” said Mrs. Briggs, coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It will be repaid if I live,” said Gilbert, warmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard such promises before,” said the lady,
contemptuously. “They are generally made to be
broken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not in my case,” said Gilbert, flushing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will not discuss the matter,” said Mrs. Briggs,
coldly. “May I ask why you have introduced this
subject?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Briggs gave me no notice that he intended to
withdraw his assistance, and I accordingly went to the
office yesterday, only to learn that he had gone to
Europe, and left no message there. I thought he
might possibly have spoken to you on the subject, and
therefore I called. My board-bill, amounting to six
dollars, is due to-night, and unfortunately I have no
funds to meet it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It must be rather humiliating for you to accept
charity,” said Mrs. Briggs. “I don’t think my son
would be willing to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say not,” said Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“Say nothing more, Mrs. Briggs,” said Gilbert,
rising. “If you regard it in that light, I wish no
assistance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t wish you to suffer,” continued Mrs.
Briggs, coldly. “I will give you money for your
board-bill, if you will tell me how much it amounts
to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, I won’t trouble you,” said Gilbert.
“I shall get along somehow. Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are impetuous. You will bear in mind that
I have not refused you the money.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will bear it in mind. Good-evening, madam.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did it well, mother,” said Randolph, admiringly,
as our hero left the house. “Will you give
me the six dollars, now he has refused it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will give it to you this week, Randolph; but
mind, I make no promises for the future.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess it’s all right,” thought Randolph, pocketing
the bills complacently. “I’ll take care she keeps
it up.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT’S PLANS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> left the house of Mrs. Briggs, not cast
down, but with a full understanding of his situation.
Until now he had had his guardian’s assistance, and,
with the income from his position as office-boy, had
felt no anxiety. Now, both had failed him, for the
time at least, and he must shift for himself. Disaster
develops the manhood in a boy as well as a man. So
Gilbert did not indulge in any gloomy anticipations of
starvation or pauperism. He never for a moment
regretted his refusal to take money from Mrs. Briggs,
offered as it had been in such a manner as to insult
his self-respect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d rather live on one meal a day,” he said
to himself stoutly, “than humble myself to that
woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>When he re-entered his room he found his room-mate
reading.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Gilbert,” he said, “did you have a pleasant
call?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So pleasant that I shall not call again in a
hurry,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then Mrs. Briggs won’t give you any assistance?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I have rejected it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you not act unwisely?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me tell you just what passed between us, and
you shall judge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The young man listened attentively. When Gilbert
had finished his story, he said, emphatically,
“You did just right. I should have done the same
thing in your circumstances.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am glad you approve of my action. I couldn’t
stoop to take money offered as charity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you have got to strike out for yourself, it
seems?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, and I must settle to-night what I shall do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you made up your mind to anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I was thinking about that as I walked home. To
begin with, I will borrow money of you to pay Mrs.
White, if you are still willing to lend it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will lend it to you with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I had better leave this house, obtain a
cheaper room, and board at a restaurant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think you can save much that way. Mrs.
White is very reasonable in her charges.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that, but the probability is that I can’t
pay her. I must be strictly economical. I am not
sure but the best thing I can do is to go to the Newsboys’
Lodge.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would never do,” he said. “It would not suit
a boy brought up as you have been.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t suppose it would; but I don’t expect to
suit myself. That is not the question with me. I
must do as I can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then stay here. If you can’t pay your whole
board at the week’s end I will make up the balance.
I should have to pay more, at any rate, if I occupied
the room alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Gilbert reflected a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind, Mr. Ingalls,” he said, “and I
will accept your offer, on one condition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That you lend me the money, and I will repay it
as soon as I am able.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I agree to that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will stay, for a week or two at least.
Now I want to ask your advice. I must find something
to do at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish there was a vacancy in our establishment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only want temporary employment. I expect
Mr. Sands will take me back on his return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t think of that. Have you thought of
anything?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going to try my luck as a newsboy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“As a newsboy! What will your friends, the
Vivians, say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know, and I can’t afford to care. I must get
a living somehow for the next few days, and I would
rather sell papers than black boots. In the afternoon
I shall try to get a little baggage-smashing to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“I admire your pluck, Gilbert,” said his room-mate.
“Not many boys, brought up as you have
been, would be willing to sell papers in the streets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t pretend to like it,” said Gilbert; “but I
would rather do it than sponge on others, or take
money flung at me as alms. If you object to rooming
with a common newsboy,” he added, smiling, “I suppose
I must look for another boarding-place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait till I give you notice to quit,” said Ingalls.
“In the mean time I will do all I can to encourage
you. I will buy a morning paper of you to-morrow
morning. Where shall you stand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Near the ‘Times’ building, I think. Don’t forget
your promise now. If I have one customer
engaged I shall sleep more soundly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can rely upon me. Have you got money
enough to start yourself in business? If not, command
my purse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will borrow fifty cents, to make sure that I have
enough. Now, as I must be up betimes and take an
early breakfast, I think I will turn in.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>“Good-night, then. I will stay up and read
awhile longer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a plucky boy,” thought the young man.
“He deserves to succeed, and I believe he will.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT BECOMES A NEWSBOY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>At</span> an early hour the next morning Gilbert took
his stand near the office of the daily “Times.” He
attracted immediate attention from the members of the
new profession in which he had enrolled himself without
permission.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doin’ here?” asked Jim Noonan,
a tall newsboy, with red hair and freckled face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am selling papers,” answered Gilbert, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What business have you here anyhow? That’s
my place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not interfere with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better not,” said Jim, pugnaciously, under
the impression that Gilbert was apologising. “Just
you leave here!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert eyed him quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall not interfere with you,” he repeated; “nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>will I allow you to interfere with me,” he added,
firmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim looked at him attentively, and his opinion of
him was somewhat altered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does a boy with good clothes want selling
papers?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wants to make a living,” said Gilbert.
“Paper, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man addressed purchased a four-cent paper.
Gilbert made change in a business-like manner, and
directly afterwards sold another, while Jim Noonan
looked on enviously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve a good mind to bust your head,” he said,
angrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Better go to work and look for customers,” suggested
Gilbert, coolly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim eyed him with angry discontent. He would
like to have pitched into him, but Gilbert was compactly
made, and, though smaller than his fellow-newsboy,
looked difficult to handle. Jim had hoped
to frighten him; but his success was not encouraging.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert, on the whole, succeeded beyond his anticipations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Probably his appearance was in his favor,
and attracted customers. But this was not all. He
was quick and alert in manner, and kept a good look-out
for trade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How many papers have you sold?” asked Jim,
after a while.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifty,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fifty!” ejaculated Jim; “why, I aint sold but
twenty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t attended to business as closely as I
have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ef it hadn’t been for you I’d have sold a good
many more.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That isn’t the reason. You would have sold as
many as I if you had tried as hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s mean, a boy like you comin’ down, and takin’
away a poor boy’s business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shan’t sell papers any longer than I have to. I
hope next week to go into something else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then a gentleman inquired for a paper which
Gilbert was out of.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“I think he’s got it,” said Gilbert, pointing to
Jim, thereby obtaining a customer for the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We may as well help each other,” said Gilbert.
“There’s no use in quarrelling.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you mean that?” asked Jim, doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You aint as mean as I thought you was,” said
Jim, his dislike beginning to evaporate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you’ll stick to that opinion,” said Gilbert,
good-humoredly. “When I go out of this business
I’ll recommend my friends to patronize you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus far Gilbert had seen no one whom he knew.
That trial was yet to come. I call it a trial, because
Gilbert was quite aware that in becoming a newsboy
he had made a descent in the social scale. He had
taken the step as a matter of necessity, and not because
he liked it. He knew very well how it would
be regarded by his acquaintances, and he rather
dreaded the expressions of surprise which it would
elicit.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first acquaintance to greet him was Alphonso
Jones.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Good gracious, Greyson!” he exclaimed, “what
are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Selling papers,” answered Gilbert, flushing a
little.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you was in a broker’s office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I was, and hope to be again; but just now I’m
out of a place, so I’ve gone into business on my own
account.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, good gracious, how can you sell papers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the only thing that offered, and I must earn
my living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose the Count Ernest de Montmorency
should see you,—what would he say?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope he would buy a paper of me,” returned
Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your friends, the Vivians,—they would be
awfully shocked.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t help it. I must earn a living. Won’t
you have a paper, Mr. Jones? I’ve got all the morning
papers—‘Times,’ ‘Tribune,’ ‘Herald,’ ‘Sun.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m afraid I haven’t got any change,” said Alphonso,
whose large expenditure for clothing compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>him to economize on minor matters. “But,
really, now, you aint going to keep the thing up, are
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Till I get something better,” said Gilbert, firmly.
“I hope that will be soon. I don’t like it myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s so—so ungentlemanly a business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t agree with you, Mr. Jones; I think it
perfectly respectable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes, of course; but it is not high-toned,
you’ll admit that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps not,” said Gilbert, with a smile. “I
don’t pretend to be a judge of what is high-toned. I
hope you won’t cut my acquaintance, Mr. Jones,
because I am a newsboy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, of course not; but I am afraid your
friends, the Vivians, will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope not,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>Alphonso Jones departed, and next in order came
John,—Gilbert’s successor at the broker’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my eye!” he exclaimed, in genuine astonishment;
“you don’t mean to say you’ve turned
newsboy?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“Yes, I have. Will you buy a paper?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Haven’t got a cent. How’s business?” asked
John, with a grin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hope you’ve got a permanent situation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think not. I don’t expect to sell papers more
than a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you going to do then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Going back into the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What office?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sands’ office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you think he’d take back a—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Stop there!” said Gilbert, sternly. “You
know very well the charge against me is false. Fortunately
I am in a position to prove it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are?” asked John, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can you prove it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will let you know when the time comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John was not disposed to continue the conversation.
He walked back to the office, and told Simon Moore
that Gilbert was selling papers in the square.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“I am glad his pride is brought low,” said Moore,
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it isn’t,” said John. “He is as proud as
ever. He says he is coming back here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let him talk,” said the book-keeper, contemptuously.
“That is all it will amount to.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But John did not feel quite certain of this.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT’S SECOND DAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“<span class='sc'>How</span> much did you make in your new business,
Gilbert?” inquired his room-mate, Ingalls, with interest,
at the close of his first day’s experience.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seventy-five cents,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is quite fair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose it is all I could reasonably expect, but
it won’t pay my expenses. At that rate my weekly
income will be but four dollars and a half, while, as
you know, my board amounts to six dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will pay the extra dollar and a half.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are a true friend, Mr. Ingalls,” said Gilbert,
gratefully, “but that doesn’t dispose of all my difficulties.
I shall have no money for washing, or to
purchase clothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But you expect to get your place back in a
week.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Even if I do, my income will be only five dollars.
I never supposed it was so difficult to make a living
before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait and hope, Gilbert,” said his room-mate,
cheerfully. “That is what I had to do when I first
came to the city. It was weeks before I got anything
to do at all. I got almost discouraged. Finally,
through the influence of a friend, I got a foothold, and
have been able to live comfortably ever since.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t get discouraged just yet, at any rate,”
said Gilbert. “I will wait and see how things come
out. If I am forced to remain in the paper business,
I must find some way of increasing my income. I
might combine a little baggage-smashing with it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s one thing I like about you, Gilbert,”
said the young man. “You have no false shame, but
undertake whatever work you find to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am not wholly without pride, Mr. Ingalls; but I
can’t afford to indulge it. I shall get out of this
street business as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are justified in that, certainly. It shows a
proper ambition.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>The next day Gilbert sought his chosen place, and
again proceeded to sell his stock of daily papers, with
about the same measure of success.</p>

<p class='c010'>At about half-past ten he caught sight of a familiar
face. His own face blushed uncomfortably, for Randolph
Briggs was about the last person he wished to
see, under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph, who was rather near-sighted, did not
recognize him till he was close upon him. Gilbert
had a momentary impulse to desert his post, and thus
escape the notice of his unwelcome acquaintance; but
this impulse was succeeded by the more manly resolve
to stand his ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have nothing to be ashamed of,” he said to himself.
“It is Randolph, or rather his mother, who
should be ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was in the act of selling a “Herald” when
Randolph came up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert Greyson!” exclaimed Randolph, in
amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Randolph,” said Gilbert, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are you doing?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“Selling papers, as you see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t mean to say you have become a common
newsboy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know whether I am a common or uncommon
newsboy, but a newsboy I certainly am, just at
present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What induced you to take up such a business?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The necessity of making a living.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why didn’t you take the money my mother
offered you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because she offered it as charity. I don’t accept
charity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It seems to me you are poor and proud.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I certainly am poor, and my pride I hope is a
proper one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should be too proud to sell papers in the streets,”
said Randolph, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps you wouldn’t in my case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I never expect to be in your case.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you won’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, of course, you will have to give up
your fashionable acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Does that mean you and your mother?” inquired
Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes partly,” answered Randolph, seriously.
“Then, there are the Vivians. You wouldn’t presume
to call upon them now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you suppose they admit newsboys in the list
of their visitors?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know; but I shall soon find out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I mean to call there very soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wouldn’t. You wouldn’t be welcome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It stands to reason,” argued Randolph. “They
stand very high in the social scale, and a newsboy is
very low.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think the Vivians and you quite agree in
some matters. If I find I am not welcome, you may
be sure I won’t repeat the call.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will see I am right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose, from what you say, that I shall not be
welcome at your house?” said Gilbert, rather amused.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Why, you might call when no one is there. Of
course, we couldn’t introduce you to our friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think the safest way will be not to call at all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so,” said Randolph, and he walked on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose that is the way of the world,” thought
Gilbert. “Well, I expected it, and so far as Randolph
and his mother are concerned I shall not have
much to regret.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At half-past twelve he stood with his last paper in
his hand. They had gone off more slowly than the
day before, and he doubted whether he could dispose
of the last one.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-morning, Gilbert,” said a cordial voice.
“Are you reading the paper?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Mr. Vivian,” answered our hero; “I am
trying to sell it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What! Have you turned newsboy?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. I could think of nothing else to do,
and I must do something.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was this necessary?” asked the merchant, in a
tone of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Yes, sir; I have nothing to depend upon, except
what I make in this way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t make a living, can you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid not by this alone,” said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you had lunch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then come with me to the Astor House restaurant.
There we will talk over your affairs, and
perhaps I can suggest something that will be more to
your advantage than your present employment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir; I shall feel very grateful for
your advice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They went to the Astor House, which was very
near, and seated themselves at a table. Mr. Vivian
ordered a substantial lunch, considerably better than
Gilbert could have afforded on his own account. In
fact, he had decided to content himself with an apple,
and make that do till the six-o’clock dinner at his
boarding-house.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A NOVEL PROPOSITION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>A liberal</span> lunch was ordered, and placed before
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My time is limited,” said Mr. Vivian, “and we
will economize it by discussing lunch and your affairs
at the same time. How much do you pay for board?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Six dollars a week,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is very little,” said the merchant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I room with another person, and thus secure more
favorable terms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are your meals satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The food is plain, but good. I have nothing to
complain of. I should like nothing better than to
feel sure that I could continue to pay my expenses
at this rate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is well,” said Mr. Vivian, approvingly. “I
like your spirit. You are not disposed to find unnecessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>fault. Then you cannot make six dollars
a week by selling papers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir; at least, I have not done so thus far.
Yesterday I made seventy cents, and to-day about the
same sum.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will never do. It leaves you nothing for
washing or clothes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. However, I am pretty well provided
with clothes. I don’t expect to require anything in
that line for six months.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Probably you couldn’t put off washing for so
long,” suggested Mr. Vivian, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hardly,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Before you came to the city,” said Mr. Vivian,
apparently changing the subject, “you were studying
for college, were you not?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How far had you proceeded?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By next summer I could easily have been ready
to enter Yale College; if necessary, earlier.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you must be a good classical scholar
already.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“A fair one,” said Gilbert, modestly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you ever think of teaching?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know who would employ a boy like me,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You would be competent to instruct a beginner in
Latin and the common English studies, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to be, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I will tell you an idea I have had in mind
for a week or more. My boy Fred is attending a
classical school, but his progress is not satisfactory to
me. I don’t think him lacking in capacity, but he
does not apply himself as he ought. It has occurred
to me that assistance in the evening would materially
aid him, and promote his standing in school. Except
in Latin I could myself assist him, but after the
business and perplexities of the day I am in no mood
to turn teacher. Now, you are competent, and Fred
has taken a fancy to you. Are you willing to give
him five evenings a week?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing would suit me better, sir,” said Gilbert,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>quickly. “I like Fred, and would do my best to be
of service to him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Vivian looked pleased.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then,” he said, “I see no reason why we should
not try the experiment. The only thing remaining to
be discussed is the compensation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I leave that to you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I may take advantage of your confidence,” said
the merchant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t feel alarmed,” said Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose, then, we say ten dollars a week for five
evenings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ten dollars!” exclaimed Gilbert, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is not adequate—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, Mr. Vivian, my services would never be
worth ten dollars a week. Remember, sir, I am only
a boy, and inexperienced as a teacher.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe you will do Fred more good than an
older and more experienced teacher. He takes to
you, and will work cheerfully with you, while I
don’t think he would with the other.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“But ten dollars a week is a large sum for you
to pay, Mr. Vivian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe in paying a good price, and requiring
good, faithful work, such as I think you will render.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will try to render it, at any rate, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it is a bargain, is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir, if you say so. I need not say that it
will be a very great help to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know that, Gilbert; and I am glad to be able to
serve you, at the same time that I serve myself.
When I was a boy I was in limited circumstances.
The memory of my own past makes me considerate
of others. Now, when will you begin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This evening, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should like it. We will expect you then.
Here is a week’s pay in advance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Vivian took from his pocket-book a ten-dollar
bill and placed it in Gilbert’s hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Under the circumstances,” he said, “you may as
well give up selling papers.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be very glad to give it up, sir, and now I
shall feel able to do so.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“I appreciate and respect your motives in doing
what you could find to do, but now you are a teacher,—a
classical professor,—and must do nothing incompatible
with the dignity of your learned profession.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will try to remember it, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must leave you now. Let us see you this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will be sure to come, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Gilbert left the hotel, he felt elated at his
unexpected good fortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe the tide has turned,” he said to himself.
“I little dreamed that my Latin would prove such a
friend in need. I can’t expect to earn the liberal sum
Mr. Vivian has agreed to pay me, but I will do my
duty as faithfully and well as I can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just after dinner that evening Alphonso Jones
strolled into Gilbert’s room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is the newspaper business?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pretty fair,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think we ought to patronize Mr. Greyson, eh,
Mr. Ingalls?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“Thank you, Mr. Jones, but I have retired from
the business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say! Why, you told me it was fair.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall retire nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you found another place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have obtained another position.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have! What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Professor of the Classics and English Literature.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re joking,” remarked Alphonso, rather bewildered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I am not. I have been engaged to teach
five evenings in the week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know you were such a scholar,” said Mr.
Jones, surprised. “Do they pay you much?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Two dollars an evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good gracious! That is splendid pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, it is very good pay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where are you to teach?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Vivian’s son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He don’t know that you have been a newsboy,
does he?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>“Yes, he does; he saw me selling papers in the
street to-day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Greyson, all I can say is, you are the
luckiest boy I ever knew. I wish I could earn two
dollars an evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll try to get you a chance,” said Gilbert,
demurely. “What can you teach?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I aint very fresh in my studies,” said
Alphonso. “I guess it wouldn’t be of any use.
Aint you going to work in the daytime?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall get back into the broker’s office if I
can.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you will have quite an income for a boy,
Gilbert,” said Mr. Ingalls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think you could take me up and introduce
me to the Vivians some evening?” insinuated
Alphonso.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think I could, Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! it’s of no consequence,” said Alphonso, with
apparent indifference. “I have any quantity of high-toned
friends who move in the first circles. Some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>them know the Vivians, and that’s why I wanted to
be introduced.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder if that fellow expects to be believed,”
said Mr. Ingalls, after Alphonso had retired.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE NEW PROFESSOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Fred Vivian</span> had not been informed of the plan
which his father had in view for him. Mr. Vivian,
however, felt confident that it would be agreeable to
his son, and did not wish to speak of it until he had
ascertained Gilbert’s willingness.</p>

<p class='c010'>At dinner, after the interview described in the last
chapter, Mr. Vivian for the first time mentioned the
matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What lessons have you to-night, Fred?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have my Latin, and some hard sums in Reduction.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How are you getting on in Latin?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish you would let me give it up, father,” said
Fred, earnestly. “I believe it was only got up to
trouble school-boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“I suppose,” said his father, smiling, “you think
Cæsar, Virgil, and Cicero only wrote with the same
purpose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Confound them! Why couldn’t they write in
English?” said Fred, petulantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>All at the table laughed, and finally Fred himself
joined in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suspect the Roman boys would have found as
much trouble with English as you find with Latin,”
said Mr. Vivian. “As a fact, there was no such
language in existence then as our modern English
tongue.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish Latin were as easy as English,” said
Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No doubt it is. Foreigners find our language
very difficult.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Difficult! I don’t see what there is difficult
about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because it is your native language. Roman boys
would have been equally surprised at any one finding
Latin difficult.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“I wish I was a Roman boy, then. Laura, will
you help me about my sums?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have got my own lessons to prepare, Fred.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you help me, father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like to have my evenings to myself, Fred.
However, don’t look disappointed. You shall have
help.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who will help me? Laura says she can’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have engaged a professor to come here every
evening, and assist you about your lessons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A professor!” exclaimed Fred, uneasily. “That
will be as bad as being at an evening school. I would
rather get along by myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just now you wanted help,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want a professor. He will make me
work too hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you will like him,” said Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When is he coming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This evening. He will be here about eight
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Isn’t this a new plan?” asked Mrs. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“Don’t you approve of it, my dear?” asked her
husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought his presence might be a restraint upon
us, unless, indeed, Fred goes upstairs with him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, let me stay here,” urged Fred. “I don’t
want to go off with that old man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you know he is an old man?” inquired
his father, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose he is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He can’t be considered so. In fact, he is rather
young.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all the same,” said Fred, discontentedly. “I
suppose he is as stiff as a poker.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He did not impress me so. With his help you
will get through your lessons quickly; and then you
can have the rest of the evening to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is his name?” asked Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will see if I can find his card,” said Mr.
Vivian, pretending to search his pockets in vain.
“Never mind, I will ask him when he comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You did not tell me you thought of making this
arrangement for Fred,” said Mrs. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“I see,” said her husband, smiling, “that you are
a little in doubt as to its expediency. If at the end
of a week it appears unsatisfactory I will dismiss the
professor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Fred was relieved by this promise. He had already
formed in his own mind an image of the expected
teacher,—a tall, thin man, in a rusty-black suit,
wearing a pair of iron-bowed spectacles. He had
seen the tutor of a schoolmate of his who answered
this description, and hastily adopted the conclusion
that most visiting tutors were like him.</p>

<p class='c010'>At ten minutes of eight Gilbert Greyson was
announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O Gilbert, I’m so glad to see you,” said Fred;
“though I’m afraid I can’t be with you much this
evening.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father has engaged a professor to assist me in
my studies; when you came in I thought at first it
was he.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert read the joke in Mr. Vivian’s smiling face,
and determined to keep it up.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>“What sort of a teacher is he?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t know. I suppose he’s an old fogy in
spectacles.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you think you shall like him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Father says if I don’t he’ll send him off at the
end of the week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Gilbert smiled, and Mr. Vivian laughed
outright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see what you two are laughing about,”
said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a good joke, Gilbert, isn’t it?” said the
merchant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see any joke,” said Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nor I,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps the professor may be willing to help you,
if you require it, Laura,” suggested her father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If he is such a man as Fred expects,” said
Laura, “I would rather get along by myself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is hardly fair to take a prejudice against a
person before you see him, Laura.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>“For my own part, I was favorably impressed by
what I saw of him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What does he look like? Is he tall?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he old?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; quite young.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has he whiskers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t see any.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he good-looking?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is rather a delicate question, eh, Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. I will answer it for you. He is not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What—do you know him, Gilbert?” asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ought to,” said Mr. Vivian. “He has seen
him in his looking-glass every morning for sixteen
years. There, the secret is out Fred, let me
formally introduce you to Professor Gilbert,—the
teacher I have engaged for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you really to be my teacher, Gilbert?”
asked Fred, delighted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you conclude to keep me,” said our hero,
“you may decide to send me adrift at the end of
the week.”</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Gilbert in a new role.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“I said that when I thought it was somebody else,”
said Fred. “Do you think you can show me how to
do sums in Reduction?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I can,” said Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will get you to help me in Interest, Gilbert,”
said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought you didn’t want any help from your
brother’s teacher,” said Mr. Vivian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know who it was to be then, papa. I’m
glad you have engaged Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is one more objection to you, Gilbert,”
said Mr. Vivian, seriously; “my wife thinks your
presence may be a restraint upon us. She thinks
you had better retire with Fred to some other part of
the house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have got the joke upon me too,” said Mrs.
Vivian. “I, too, was quite in the dark as to whom
you had engaged. We don’t look upon Gilbert in
the light of a stranger, but rather as one of the
family.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Mrs. Vivian,” said our hero, gratefully.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>“Then it appears, Gilbert, that you will be allowed
to practise your vocation here. I would suggest that
a pair of spectacles would make your appearance
more impressive and dignified.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I like you best as you are, Gilbert,” said Fred,
putting his arm around the neck of his new tutor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And I too,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I won’t go to the expense of spectacles,”
said Gilbert. “Shall we begin now, Fred?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Fred brought his arithmetic and slate, and Gilbert
explained the sums in a familiar manner, making
Fred do them himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I understand them first-rate now,” said Fred, in
a tone of satisfaction. “You’re a bully teacher,
Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, shall we take the Latin?” asked Gilbert.
“I’ll try to be a <i>bully</i> teacher in that also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>By nine o’clock Fred’s task was completed, and
Gilbert transferred his attention to Laura. Fifteen
minutes were all she required. The evening work
being over, Gilbert played at games with his two
pupils till ten, then rose to go.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“I’m so glad you’re my teacher,” said Fred.
“Be sure to come to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid you will get tired of me after a
while, and want to discharge me,” said Gilbert,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you promise to stay with us till you are
discharged?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Fred.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it’s all right,” said Fred, in a tone of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Vivian found that he had done a very popular
thing in engaging Gilbert, and was, in consequence,
pleased himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, Gilbert,” said his room-mate, on his return,
“how did your first lesson come off?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“With flattering success. I never earned money
more pleasantly in my life. My old teacher would
stare if he should learn that I had set myself up as
a classical professor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your fortune has changed wonderfully. From
a newsboy to professor is rather a startling transformation.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“My career as a newsboy is ended. I abandon the
field to my competitors, and devote myself to the
dissemination of learning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alphonso Jones thinks you are a very remarkable
young man. He told me so to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can return the compliment,” said Gilbert,
laughing. “If you can change a ten-dollar bill, Mr.
Ingalls, I will pay you the six dollars advanced for
my board.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You needn’t be in a hurry, Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t like to be in debt. I can sleep better
when I have paid up the loan.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall be glad to lend you again if you need it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, Mr. Ingalls; but I hope I shan’t
need it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Early the next morning Mr. Sands reached
New York, having come through by night from
Washington.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BROKER’S RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>About</span> ten o’clock, on the morning of his arrival,
Mr. Sands entered his office. He had kept the run
of the business through letters from Mr. Moore, the
book-keeper; but the latter had omitted to mention
Gilbert’s dismissal, and the reinstatement of John
as his successor.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands was therefore surprised to see John in
the office, with his hat off.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is Gilbert?” he asked, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>John looked confused.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’ll tell you,” he said, pointing to his cousin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you dismissed Gilbert, Mr. Moore?”
demanded Mr. Sands, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Moore, in spite of his bravado, was a little nervous.
He was apprehensive that he would not be able to
convince Mr. Sands of Gilbert’s guilt.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“I was obliged to discharge him, I am sorry to
say,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you discharge him, may I inquire?”
persisted the broker.</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore, himself of a haughty disposition,
flushed at the imperative tone which his employer
used. It chafed him especially to be so addressed
in the presence of his young cousin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t suppose you wish to have a thief in your
employ,” he answered, hastily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you charge Gilbert Greyson with being a
thief?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me know the particulars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore rehearsed the story, already familiar
to the reader, of the ten-dollar bill found in the
pocket of Gilbert’s overcoat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he admit his guilt?” asked the broker.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no, he brazened it out; but the proofs
were overwhelming.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who found the bill in Gilbert’s pocket?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“John.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“Oh!” ejaculated the broker, significantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore’s face flushed again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let me explain,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By all means; that is what I want.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Only John, who had come in to make a call on
me, and Gilbert had been here. One or the other
must have been the thief. I therefore asked Gilbert
to search John, and John to search Gilbert. It
seemed to me fair. The result showed who was
the thief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Upon this, you discharged Gilbert, and engaged
John.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. I needed a boy, and did not dare to
employ Gilbert lest there should be further and more
serious losses. John being present, and understanding
the duties, I engaged him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“John is your cousin, is he not, Mr. Moore?”
asked Mr. Sands, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir,” said the book-keeper, looking slightly
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was very fortunate for him that he happened
to be at the office on that particular morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Here John thought it time to introduce himself
into the conversation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s what Cousin Simon told me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If John had not been here, I should have been
obliged to advertise for a boy,” said the book-keeper,
recovering his confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you seen Gilbert since?” inquired Mr.
Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have,” said John, grinning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did you see him? Do you know if he
has another situation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes,” said John, chuckling; “he’s set up
on his own account.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“T’other morning I saw him selling papers near
the City Hall Park.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Humph!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands said no more, but set about examining the
books. Presently he put on his hat and went out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you think he’s going to do, Cousin
Simon?” asked John, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess the storm’s blown over.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“He didn’t seem to like it that I was here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He don’t have a very high opinion of you; and
I don’t blame him,” said the book-keeper, unable to
restrain his sarcasm, although John was his cousin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seems to me you’re pretty hard on me,” said
John, aggrieved. “Do you think he’ll let me
stay?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think he will, if you do your duty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I’ll do that fast enough,” said John, looking
relieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I advise you not to let Mr. Sands see you with a
cigarette in your mouth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who told you I smoked cigarettes? It’s a—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better not finish the sentence. I saw you
last evening on the street with one in your mouth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I’ll have to be more careful,” said John
to himself. “Who’d have thought he’d find out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was just trying it to see how it seemed,” he
explained.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you know now, and you’d better give them
up,” said Simon Moore. “Now, go to the post-office
for the mail.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>On his way home, in the afternoon, Mr. Sands was
looking about for a seat in the crowded car, when a
boy addressed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take my seat, Mr. Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert!” exclaimed the broker, cordially, extending
his hand. “I have been hoping to meet
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When did you get home from Washington, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“This morning early. I was surprised not to find
you in your accustomed place in my office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose Mr. Moore explained my absence?”
said Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; but I should prefer to hear your explanation.
I should have more faith in its truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, gratefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is hardly a matter to talk about in public.
Have you any engagement this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then come around to my house, and take dinner.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What will Mr. Moore say?” asked Gilbert
smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We will see to-morrow. Will you come?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“With great pleasure, Mr. Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands lived in a pleasant house up-town. He
had a wife but no children. His wife greeted Gilbert
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have heard my husband speak of you,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before dinner Gilbert got a chance to explain
matters to Mr. Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe you,” said the broker, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t rely too much upon my word, sir,” said
Gilbert. “I want you to be thoroughly convinced
of my innocence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Still, sir, I should like to bring a street boy—a
boot-black—to confirm my story. He saw John put
the bill into my overcoat pocket, when I was out on
an errand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is important testimony. I trust your word
implicitly; but it may be as well to bring him round
to the office, in order to confound those who have got
up this wicked plot against you.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>“He is only a boot-black,” said Gilbert; “but I
think he is trustworthy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have reasons with which you are not acquainted
for believing him and you,” said the broker.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert looked curious, and Mr. Sands explained.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was present in an oyster-saloon, one evening
before I started for Washington, and overheard Mr.
Moore and John expressing their intentions to get
you into trouble during my absence. This was the
reason why I warned you against the book-keeper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember it, sir; but I did not know your
reasons.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, tell me how you have got along, being suddenly
deprived of your income. John told me he
saw you selling papers near City Hall Park one
day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true, sir. I could make something that
way, and so I tried it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I respect you the more for it. Have you kept
up this employment till now?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir. Mr. Vivian has engaged me as tutor
for his son, at a salary of ten dollars per week.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“Is it possible? That is remarkable, considering
your youth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was to help me, sir, I have no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must be a good scholar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not necessarily; Fred is only just beginning
Latin, and it does not require much learning to
teach him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If your time is so profitably occupied, I suppose
I can’t induce you to come back into my office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should be very glad to do so, sir. I only give
my evenings to Fred Vivian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you may come back to-morrow, at a salary
of seven dollars a week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are very kind, sir. I fear I shall not earn
so much.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is my lookout. Come to-morrow, at quarter-past
nine. If I am not there, say nothing to Mr.
Moore about resuming your situation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>After dinner Gilbert went to Mr. Vivian’s, to
meet his pupil.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT’S TRIUMPH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Shortly</span> after the office opened on the following
day, Simon Moore and John were disagreeably surprised
by the entrance of Gilbert. He had found
his witness, Tom, the boot-black, and requested him
to remain outside, within call.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you want here?” demanded the book-keeper,
frowning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Has Mr. Sands returned?” asked our hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, he hasn’t,” replied Moore, with unblushing
falsehood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you must be mistaken,” said Gilbert,
composedly; “for I saw him getting on a street-car
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then if you knew he was at home, why did you
ask me?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Gilbert did not think it necessary to answer this
question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will stop and speak to him,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, you won’t,” said Simon Moore, roughly.
“I know what you want. You want to make him
believe you are innocent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right, Mr. Moore. I do wish to convince
him of my innocence.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess you’ve got cheek,” put in John.
“Didn’t I find the money that was lost, in your
overcoat pocket?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s enough, I should say,” said the book-keeper,
dexterously availing himself of this admission.
“You are a witness, John, that he has confessed
the theft.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you twist what I say in that way,” said Gilbert,
indignantly, “there is no use in my saying
anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is true enough. There is no use in your
saying anything. Now, I’ve got something more to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>say. You’ve no business in this office; and the
sooner you clear out the better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, the sooner you clear out the better,” chimed
in John. “You’ve come here to get away my place;
but you’d better give up trying. Mr. Sands is not
such a fool as to believe you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going?” demanded the book-keeper,
menacingly. “John, put him out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John advanced cautiously towards our hero, who
smiled unterrified.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come, go out!—do you hear?” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I won’t put you to the trouble of putting me out,”
said Gilbert, good-naturedly. “I’ll step out for the
present.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And go away from here,—do you hear? Don’t
you hang around the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert, however, did not see fit to obey this last
order. He waited in the neighborhood for Mr. Sands
to arrive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He means to make trouble, Cousin Simon,” said
John, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He would like to, no doubt,” responded the book-keeper;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“but it would be very strange if Mr. Sands
believed him against us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I hope it’ll all turn out right,” said John;
“but he’s got a lot of cheek—that boy has. I
wish you’d had him locked up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It might have been the best plan; but I think we
can carry things through. Don’t you put in your
oar, or you may spoil the whole thing. Leave it to
me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Cousin Simon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At the corner of Wall and New Streets Gilbert met
Mr. Sands, who had come down-town, in a Broadway
stage.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see you are on hand,” said the broker. “Have
you been to the office?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a reception did you get from
Mr. Moore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ordered me out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The broker smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps it may be my turn to order out,” he said.
“Come back with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore was not over-pleased when he saw
Gilbert entering the office with his employer, but he
said nothing. He waited to see how the land lay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Moore,” said the broker, “I met Gilbert
outside, and have brought him in to talk over the
charge which you bring against him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has been here already,” said Moore, coldly,
“and I ordered him out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It appears to me that this is rather summary
treatment.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think I have treated him very indulgently. I
might have had him arrested for theft, but I didn’t
want to be too hard upon him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You seem to take it for granted that he is
guilty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He <i>must</i> be. He will himself admit that the
missing bill was found in his overcoat pocket; ask
him, if you like, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands turned to Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is true,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“That is all that need be said,” said the book-keeper,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does not necessarily follow that he put the bill
in himself,” remarked Mr. Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who else could have done it?” demanded Moore,
triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will answer that question,” said Gilbert.
“John put the money in my pocket, in order to
get me into a scrape.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you hear that, Cousin Simon?” exclaimed
John, with virtuous indignation. “I didn’t think
Gilbert could be so wicked as to say such things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I expected it,” said Moore, regarding Gilbert
maliciously. “A boy that will steal will lie also.
Of course he only says it to screen himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert listened to this outbreak very composedly.
He knew that his employer was on his side, and did
not think it necessary to contradict it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you any proof of your statement, Gilbert?”
asked Mr. Sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course he hasn’t,” said Moore, contemptuously.
“It rests upon his word; and that is worth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>nothing. Ask him if he saw John put the money
in his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I did not,” answered Gilbert, without waiting
for Mr. Sands to put the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought not,” said Moore, triumphantly. “You
only suspected it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Somebody saw it done,” said Gilbert. “Shall I
call him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The question was addressed to Mr. Sands, who
nodded his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert went to the door, and called Tom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Tom, the boot-black, shuffled in, with his box
strapped to his back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tom,” said Gilbert, “did you, one day, see
John—that boy there—putting a bill in my coat-pocket?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” answered Tom, “shure I did; but I
thought it was his own, and it was no harm, till
you told me how you’d lost your place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands put two or three questions, which Tom
answered in a straightforward manner. Then he
turned to the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>“What do you say to this, Mr. Moore?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I say that it is all a lie,” returned the book-keeper,
angrily. “How much are you paid for
lying?” he demanded, sharply, of the boot-black.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a cent,” said Tom, indignantly; “and it
isn’t a lie either, you spalpeen! You knew all
about it, too. I saw you lookin’ at him when he
did it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d like to thrash you, within an inch of your
life, you impudent young blackguard!” said Simon
Moore, furiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better not try it,” said Tom, boldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope, Mr. Sands,” said Moore, turning to the
broker, “that you are not going to believe this young
ragamuffin against me. It is a pretty state of things,
if my word is to be disputed by such as he.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Moore,” said the broker, gravely, “I regret
to say that, in this instance, I am forced to believe
him rather than you. Wait a moment,”—seeing that
Moore was going to interrupt him,—“it is only fair
that I should give you my reason. Possibly you will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>remember one evening when, at an oyster-saloon, you
and John concerted this very plot against Gilbert. I
was in the next stall, and overheard all you both said.
I was not, therefore, surprised to learn, upon my
return, under what circumstances Gilbert had been
discharged.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Simon Moore and John looked at each other in
silent dismay. Both remembered well the conversation
alluded to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I am the object of such suspicion,” blustered
Moore, at length, “I don’t think I had better remain
in your employ.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I approve your decision,” said the broker, gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will leave at once, if you say so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Just then a young man entered the office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are at liberty to do so,” said Mr. Sands.
“I have already engaged this gentleman as your
successor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess I’ll go, too,” said John.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You may. Gilbert, you will resume your old
place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It would be difficult to paint the anger and mortification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>upon the faces of the two cousins as they
left the office.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This comes from trying to help you, you young
loafer,” said Moore, savagely, turning upon John.
“But for you I should have kept my place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m sure I aint to blame,” said John, whining.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are wholly to blame. I shall thrash you
some day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>John thought this rather hard, since the plot was
of his cousin’s contriving. I may remark here that
months passed before Simon Moore obtained another
situation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>MR. BRIGGS RETURNS FROM EUROPE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>So </span>Gilbert was reinstated in his old position, at an
advanced salary. His income was now seventeen
dollars a week,—an amount which enabled him to live
very comfortably, and even to lay aside a few dollars
every week. Of course, this required the exercise
of economy; but Gilbert felt it to be his duty to be
prudent, and prepare for a time when his income
might be less.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found the new book-keeper a very different man
from Mr. Moore. He was quite as efficient, and far
more agreeable. From the first he regarded Gilbert
with friendly interest, and treated him as a friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some time Gilbert had seen nothing of Randolph
Briggs. The latter occasionally condescended
to wonder how that beggar Greyson was getting
along, but did not feel any very deep anxiety on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>his account. One day, however, Randolph ventured
down-town, and had the curiosity to enter Mr. Sands’
office.</p>

<p class='c010'>The book-keeper chanced to be out, and Gilbert
was in charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph stared in astonishment at our hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How do you happen to be here?” he asked,
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why shouldn’t I be here?” returned Gilbert,
pleasantly. “This is my place of business.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, I say, I thought you were sent off.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you get back?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Sands took me back, and discharged the
book-keeper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whew!” exclaimed Randolph. “He must think
a good deal of you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He believed the charge to be false, and that it
was a conspiracy against me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph did not know what to think. He had
predicted that Gilbert would never get back; and it
is not pleasant to be mistaken in one’s predictions.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>“Do you board at the same place?” he asked,
after a while.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you find it hard to pay your board?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert smiled. The question was an impertinent
one; but he felt amused rather than offended.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have paid regularly so far,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did you do when you were out of a place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I lived on my salary as teacher.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph opened wide his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I teach in the evening,” explained our hero.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t say so! Why, you are only a boy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I know enough to teach a younger boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who are you teaching?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fred Vivian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What, Laura’s brother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He don’t come to your room, does he?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I go there five evenings in the week.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you get much pay?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>“I don’t think you can expect me to answer that
question, Randolph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, aint you willing to tell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll tell you so much,—that Mr. Vivian pays
me more than Mr. Sands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph was silent for a moment. This news was
worse than the other. He had an admiration for
Laura, and it was very disagreeable to think that
while he was not on visiting terms at her house, this
boy, so much his social inferior, should be freely admitted
to Laura’s presence. Perhaps, however, he
only saw Fred.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does Laura come into the room when you teach
her brother?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. In fact, I help her a little too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s the strangest thing I ever heard of,” muttered
Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That Mr. Vivian should take a poor office-boy to
teach his children.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is strange, but true,” assented Gilbert, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“I didn’t think you were so artful.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you hadn’t been artful, you wouldn’t have got
so thick with the Vivians.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t want to get angry with you, Randolph,
but I don’t like that remark. Suppose we change the
subject. What do you hear from your father?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was in Manchester when we last heard from
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When do you expect him home?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“In a month or six weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must be glad to have him return.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I don’t know,” said Randolph. “I’m having
a pretty good time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He don’t seem to have overmuch affection for his
father,” thought Gilbert. And Gilbert was right.
Randolph was very selfish; and his chief regard was
for himself. Even his mother, who idolized him,
received but a scant return. One reason why Randolph
would be sorry to have his father return was,
that he was now receiving, from his mother, the six
dollars a week which properly should have gone for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>Gilbert’s board; and of this he would doubtlessly be
deprived when Mr. Briggs came back.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I guess I can’t stay any longer,” said Randolph,
looking at his watch. “You haven’t been up
to the house lately.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; my evenings are engaged, you know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’d better come up and dine soon.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert was rather surprised at this invitation;
but Randolph’s motive was soon apparent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you will, I will go round to the Vivians afterwards
with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Perhaps,” suggested Gilbert, “when I want to
be away for an evening, you will go in my place.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, I guess not. I don’t think I should like
to teach. I’d rather go with you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will think of it. At any rate, I thank you for
the invitation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Randolph went home at once. He wanted to tell
his mother the news. It may well be believed that
she was not pleased. She would have been glad to
hear that he had been compelled to leave the city.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>“It seems,” said she, sharply, “that Mr. Briggs
is not the only fool in the city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wonder what father would say to hear that,”
chuckled Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know what I mean. He was perfectly infatuated
with that Greyson boy; and now it appears
that Mr. Vivian is just as much of a dupe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s very artful,” suggested Randolph.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That is the very word to use,” said Mrs. Briggs,
energetically. “It does credit to your insight into
character.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I always thought he was artful,” said Randolph,
much flattered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He never deceived <i>me</i>,” said his mother, emphatically.
“I felt instinctively that he was a boy
to be shunned. I dare say he would like to ingratiate
himself with your father so far as to induce
him to adopt him, and put him on an equality with
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By gracious, I hope not,” exclaimed Randolph,
alarmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He shall never do it with my consent,” said Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Briggs, energetically. “Fortunately you have a
mother, who is devoted to you, my son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you are, mother. You won’t let
father pay Gilbert’s board, after he gets back will
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And you’ll persuade him to give the extra
amount to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will do my best; but your father is sometimes
very obstinate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It takes you to manage him, mother. Just let
him know what you think of Gilbert.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He knows that very well already; but I will do
my best for you, Randolph.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Six weeks later Mr. Briggs arrived in New York.
Gilbert saw his name in a list of the passengers by
the last Cunard steamer, but decided not to call
upon him immediately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He would think I was applying to have my
board paid again,” he said to himself; “and that
is no longer necessary.”</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN IMPORTANT REVELATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> did not lose sight of the little flower-girl
whom he had befriended. Even when his fortunes
were at the lowest, he never failed to buy a bouquet
of her daily. More than this he did not feel able to
do then. But as soon as he obtained the position of
Fred’s teacher, he again visited Mr. Talbot in his
poor lodgings, and gave him more substantial assistance.
The sick man improved steadily in health and
spirits. It did him great good to feel that he had a
friend, though that friend was only a boy, dependent
on his earnings for support.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the day after he had heard of Mr. Briggs’ return
from Europe, Gilbert made a hurried call during
his dinner-hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How are you to-day, Mr. Talbot?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>“I am better,” said the sick man. “I hope I shall
soon be well enough to go to work again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think you will,” said Gilbert, cheerfully. “I
must try to see what I can find for you to do, among
my business friends.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you; do you know many business men?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” answered Gilbert. “I wonder,” he said,
half to himself, “whether my guardian couldn’t give
you work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your guardian!” repeated Mr. Talbot, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” said Gilbert, smiling; “but you mustn’t
think because I have a guardian that I have any
property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who is your guardian?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mr. Richard Briggs, a New York merchant.
He only got home from Europe yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Richard Briggs!” exclaimed the sick man in
evident excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; do you know anything of him?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“His name is very familiar to me. Tell me, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>you the son of James Greyson, formerly a merchant
in the West Indies?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Gilbert’s turn to be excited.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father died in the West Indies,” he answered;
“but I know very little of him. Did you know him,
Mr. Talbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I ought to know him. I was his book-keeper up
to the time of his death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is it possible?” ejaculated Gilbert. “How glad
I am to meet you! I know nothing of my father
except what Mr. Briggs has told me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“One thing I do not understand,” continued the
sick man. “You say you have no property; but this
cannot be. Your father left seventy-five thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seventy-five thousand dollars! Are you sure,
Mr. Talbot?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one can be surer. I knew all about your
father’s business and the extent of his property.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Was this money entrusted to my guardian?”
asked Gilbert, quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was. Your father and Richard Briggs were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>schoolmates, so I have heard him say; and he felt
sufficient confidence in him to confide you to his
care.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is not a pleasant moment when for the first time
we are led to suspect those in whom we have confided;
and important and welcome as the intelligence otherwise
was, Gilbert felt sober at the treachery of Mr.
Briggs. The latter, as we have seen, had been kinder
to him than his wife or son, and Gilbert had
felt grateful. Even now he could not rid himself of
a certain feeling of kindness to his guardian, false as
he had been to his trust.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sorry to hear this,” he said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sorry to hear that your father left you a fortune?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t mean that. I am sorry that my guardian
has been wicked enough to attempt to cheat me out
of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What sort of a man is Mr. Briggs?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“At first I was not prepossessed in his favor; but
he improved on acquaintance. When his wife and son
spoke against me, he always took my part. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>I was charged with dishonesty, he refused to believe
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think it quite possible that he is a naturally
kind-hearted man,” said the sick man; “but human
nature is sometimes inconsistent. I think it may
have been in a moment of embarrassment that he appropriated
your fortune. If he has since prospered,
it may be possible for you to recover it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you sure it was as much as seventy-five thousand
dollars, Mr. Talbot?” asked Gilbert, dazzled as
he well might be by the magnitude of the sum.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you prove it, so that Mr. Briggs will be compelled
to give it up to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Fortunately I can. I have in my trunk a document,
in your father’s own handwriting, giving a
schedule of his property, in which he expressly says
that he makes it over in trust to Richard Briggs, for
your use. Indeed, it must now amount to more
than seventy-five thousand dollars; for only a small
part of the income has been expended for you. Probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>a few hundreds of dollars a year are all that
have been spent for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t see how Mr. Briggs could make such false
representations,” said Gilbert, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Money is the root of all evil,’ my young friend.
It is an old proverb, and unfortunately a true one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have noticed one thing,” continued our hero.
“When I thanked Mr. Briggs for paying my board,
as I supposed, out of his own pocket, he always
seemed uncomfortable and embarrassed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That shows he is not wholly without shame.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is about time for me to be going back to the
office, Mr. Talbot; but before I go I want to ask
your advice on one point. How soon shall I speak to
Mr. Briggs on this subject?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Whenever you have an opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course, I must refer to you as my informant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“By all means,” said the sick man, promptly.
“It will be a great satisfaction to me if, through my
means, you succeed in obtaining your rights.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For the rest of the day and through the evening
Gilbert’s mind was occupied with the important intelligence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>he had learned. He did not make a confidant
of any one, feeling that it was not yet time.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Ingalls, his room-mate, saw that he was thinking
busily about something, but did not make any
inquiries. He knew that Gilbert would let him know
when he got ready. Alphonso Jones was not so forbearing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“By Jove! Greyson, I believe you are in love,” he
said, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What makes you think so, Mr. Jones?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve been sitting with your eyes fixed on the
carpet for five minutes without speaking a word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your opinion about love is worth something, Mr.
Jones,” said Gilbert, smiling. “You know how it is
yourself. Didn’t I see you walking with a fair
widow last evening?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who do you mean?” asked Alphonso, smiling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mrs. Kinney, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only happened to meet her going to a concert
with Mr. Pond,” exclaimed Alphonso. “He was
called away a moment, and left her in my care.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He was very imprudent,” said Mr. Ingalls.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>“You know, Jones, you’re a regular lady-killer. I
really hope you won’t try any of your fascinations
on the widow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Jones simpered, and was evidently pleased.
It was his private opinion that he was unusually
fascinating, and this public acknowledgment of it
was gratifying.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will have your joke, Mr. Ingalls,” he said.
“I have a high respect for Mrs. Kinney; but, really,
there is nothing in it, I do assure you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Time will show,” said Mr. Ingalls, nodding his
head in an oracular way. “But don’t be precipitate,
Mr. Jones. Remember the Countess de Montmorency,
who may yet be your bride.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have no hopes in that quarter,” said Alphonso,
who had ascertained that the count had been reduced
by family misfortunes to accept a position in a barbers
shop. “Good-evening, gents.”</p>

<p class='c010'>When Alphonso had retired, Gilbert said, “I have
something on my mind, Mr. Ingalls, though not what
Mr. Jones supposed. I hope soon to let you know
what it is.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>“Whenever you are ready, Gilbert. I am not
curious; but shall be interested in anything that
concerns you. It isn’t anything unpleasant, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It may be greatly to my advantage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If that is the case, I can wait cheerfully.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>
  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>GILBERT’S SHIP COMES IN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>It</span> may well be supposed that Gilbert wished, as
soon as possible, to question his guardian on a subject
having such an important bearing upon his
future career. It occurred to him that it might be
well to consult a lawyer first; but he finally decided
not to do so. Personally Mr. Briggs had treated
him kindly, and he did not wish, unless it should
prove absolutely necessary, to assume a position
antagonistic to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert reached his guardian’s house about eight
o’clock in the evening. He had received a note
from Fred Vivian, stating that he was going to the
theatre, and would not require a lesson that evening.
This gave him abundant time for the interview.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs and Randolph had gone to make a
call, and Gilbert found Mr. Briggs alone. In dressing-gown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>and slippers he was conning the evening
paper when Gilbert was announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good-evening, Gilbert,” said Mr. Briggs, cordially.
“I am glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert, gravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was feeling a little lonely. Mrs. Briggs and
Randolph have gone out to make a call. How have
you got on since I went away?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am doing well now, sir; but at one time my
prospects looked dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How is that?” asked Mr. Briggs, surprised.
“I thought I left you well provided for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Gilbert’s turn to look surprised.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Didn’t Randolph tell you about my losing my
situation?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a word. How came you to lose it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert told the story, already familiar to the
reader. He also told about his regaining it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That must have been disagreeable; and, of course,
you felt the loss of income. But your board was at
least provided for. You received money for that
from my office?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“No, sir; not a cent.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why not? I left directions to that effect.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert’s cheek flushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I called on Mrs. Briggs, to inquire about it,” he
said, reluctantly; “but she chose to treat me as a
beggar, and I declined to receive anything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs looked annoyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am afraid,” he said, desirous of excusing his
wife, “that you are too sensitive, Gilbert. Mrs.
Briggs is a little unfortunate in her manner, and
gave you a wrong impression. However, you shall
not suffer for it. Come round to the office to-morrow,
and I will give you a sum equal to what you
would have had if I had been at home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” said Gilbert; but still he looked
grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does not that satisfy you?” asked Mr. Briggs,
a little annoyed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert felt that the time had come for his question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came here to-night, Mr. Briggs,” he commenced,
“to ask you a question.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“Ask it, of course,” said the merchant, quite
unprepared for what was coming.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert fixed his clear, penetrating eyes on his
guardian’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My father left you some money in trust for me;
did he not, sir?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. I told you so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it, sir. Will you tell me what it
amounted to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really,” said Mr. Briggs, uncomfortably, “I
can’t tell without looking over my papers. What
makes you ask?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did it not amount to seventy-five thousand dollars?”
demanded Gilbert, quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Richard Briggs nearly started from his seat in
surprise and dismay. That was the amount, as he
well knew; but how on earth could the boy have
found out? He saw that his ward had obtained
some dangerously accurate information somewhere;
and that he was thoroughly in earnest in his inquiry.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who could have put such a thought into your
head?” he asked, slowly and hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>“I won’t make a secret of it,” said Gilbert. “I
have made the acquaintance of a man who knew my
father. He tells me he was his book-keeper up to the
time of his death. He claims to know all about my
father’s affairs, and the amount of property he left.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is some great mistake,” muttered the
merchant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think there can be. Mr. Talbot has, in
his possession, and has showed to me, an autograph-letter
of my father, in which he gives full details
on this subject.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where is this Talbot?” asked Mr. Briggs,
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is living in this city.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must excuse me, Mr. Briggs. At present
I do not wish to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He may be an impostor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have thought of that; but such an imposition
could not be carried out. I think he tells the truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suppose I believe the contrary,—what, then?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have reason to know whether what he says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>is correct or not, Mr. Briggs,” said Gilbert, resolutely.
“If you deny it, and assert that he is an
impostor, I will consult a lawyer, and have him
cross-examine him on the subject, and give me his
opinion.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have not spoken to a lawyer yet?” said
Mr. Briggs, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lawyers are fond of instituting lawsuits. Probably
one would report favorably.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should want to know his grounds. And I
would not consent to a suit, unless he convinced me
there was good ground for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert,” said the merchant, “I feel friendly to
you, and I want you to succeed. Say no more about
this affair, and to-morrow I will make over to you
bank-shares amounting to ten thousand dollars. That
will give you a good start in life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I only want what is my own,” said Gilbert,
sturdily. “I want what my father left me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs rose, and paced the room in silence.
His good and bad angel were contending for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>supremacy. The conflict came to an end, and his better
nature triumphed. He resumed his seat, looking
no longer perplexed or troubled, but as one who
had thrown off a burden.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gilbert,” he said, “it is all true. I have tried
to be a villain; but I won’t be one any longer.
Your father left you a fortune, and it shall be restored
to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert rose, and grasped Mr. Briggs’ hand cordially.
Boy as he was, he comprehended the struggle
through which his guardian had passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” he said. “I shall forget all
that has passed; and I ask you to remain my
guardian, and take care of my property for me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Man of the world as he was, Mr. Briggs was
touched by this proof of generous confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t deserve this, Gilbert; but I will do as
you ask. I will, however, see a lawyer, and make
such arrangements that whatever may happen to me
you will be safe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment the bell rang.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think Mrs. Briggs and Randolph have returned,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>said the merchant. “One word, Gilbert,
of what has passed between us, let it only be known
that you have received a large legacy, and that I am
your guardian in reality as well as in name.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, sir. Perhaps I had better go. Mrs.
Briggs don’t like me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her husband laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She will change when she knows you are rich,”
he said. “Don’t be surprised. It is the way of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had scarcely finished when Mrs. Briggs entered,
followed by Randolph. She remarked Gilbert’s
presence with displeasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You here?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my dear,” said Mr. Briggs, pleasantly.
“Gilbert has been keeping me company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He came <i>on business</i>, I suppose,” sneered the
lady.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right, my dear. What made you guess
his errand?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I supposed he wanted help,” said Mrs. Briggs.
“He wants his pension restored, of course.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>“Is that what you came for, Gilbert?” asked
Randolph, uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert rather enjoyed the misapprehension of his
two enemies, but he left Mr. Briggs to answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Really, my dear, you are hardly polite to my
young ward.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your ward! Don’t be ridiculous, Mr. Briggs.
You know he hasn’t got a cent, and has to live on
charity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are quite mistaken, my dear. Gilbert has
just come into a property of over eighty thousand
dollars. And he has asked me to take charge of it
for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Briggs sank into a chair in utter stupefaction,
while Randolph opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are jesting!” Mrs. Briggs managed to
utter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at all. Is what I say correct, Gilbert?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I believe it is, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It is singular how Gilbert was transformed all at
once in the eyes of the worldly woman, and her son.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Circumstances were changed, and they must change
with them. It was awkward, but it must be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I congratulate you, Gilbert,” she said, trying to
smile. “You are certainly very fortunate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should say he was!” exclaimed Randolph.
“I say, Gilbert, come and live with us, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I should really be glad to have my husband’s
ward in my family,” said Mrs. Briggs, as graciously
as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you,” said Gilbert; “but this has come
upon me so suddenly, that I don’t know what arrangements
I shall make.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Who left you this fortune?” asked Mrs. Briggs,
curiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We are not at liberty to go into particulars,” said
Mr. Briggs; “but there is no doubt about it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you will excuse me, Mr. Briggs, I will leave
you now. I should like to tell my friends of my
good fortune.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Certainly. Come to my counting-room in the
morning at ten. Some arrangements will need to be
made.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>“I will be on hand, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dine with us to-morrow, Gilbert,” said Mrs.
Briggs, graciously. “Randolph will be so glad of
your company.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert thought it due to his guardian to accept.
He was wise enough to take the world as he found it,
and return courtesy with courtesy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What has happened, Gilbert?” exclaimed his
room-mate, when, half an hour later, Gilbert broke
into the room, his face full of excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am rich, Mr. Ingalls. I have become heir to
eighty thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good gracious!” exclaimed Alphonso Jones, who
was present. “I suppose you will go to live on
Fifth Avenue among the swells.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not at present, Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am very glad of your good luck, Gilbert,” said
his room-mate, warmly. “You must tell me all about
it by and by.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I had eighty thousand dollars,” said Alphonso.
“Wouldn’t I be high-toned?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>“Can’t one be high-toned without being rich, Mr.
Jones?” asked Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Jones thought not; but he made one mental
reservation. He privately thought himself high-toned,
though he certainly was not rich.</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Nowhere</span> did Gilbert receive heartier congratulations
on the change in his fortunes than from Mr.
Vivian and his family. Fred only was disturbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I suppose you won’t be willing to teach me any
more, now you are rich, Gilbert,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t think it will make any difference, Fred,”
said Gilbert; “but I must consult your father about
my plans.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What are your own views and wishes, Gilbert?”
asked the merchant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to get a better education,” said Gilbert.
“I should like to carry out my original plan, and go
to college. After I graduate I may devote myself to
business; but a good education won’t interfere with
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>“I approve your plan,” said Mr. Vivian. “Of
course you will resign your place at the broker’s.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I shall submit a plan for your future. We
all like you, and you can be of use to Fred. Come
and live with us. You can complete your preparation
for college at some first-class school in the city, and
enter next summer, if you like.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hope you will come, Gilbert,” said Laura.</p>

<p class='c010'>It might have been her voice which decided Gilbert
to accept. At any rate, he did accept gratefully;
and in less than a week he was installed at Mr.
Vivian’s as a member of the family.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Sands was sorry to lose his services, but
acknowledged that it was better for him to give up
his place. The day after his retirement he was
sitting in Madison Park, when John, who had once
caused him to lose his place, espied him. John had
not yet succeeded in securing a place, nor had Mr.
Moore, the book-keeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What brings you here at this time in the day?”
asked John, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>“I am a gentleman of leisure,” answered Gilbert.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you left Mr. Sands?” asked John, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Been bounced, eh?” asked John, radiantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gilbert smiled. He understood John’s feelings.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he answered. “I left of my own accord.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You haven’t got another place?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then it’s too thin, your leaving of your own
accord.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It does look so, I admit,” said Gilbert, good-humoredly.
“But it is true, nevertheless.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you leave, then? You haven’t had a
fortune left you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve hit it, John. I no longer need my pay.
I have become rich, and shall go on preparing for
college.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that really so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is quite true.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Some folks are lucky,” said John, enviously.
“I aint one of that kind. I wish I could get your
old place.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“I am afraid Mr. Sands wouldn’t take you back.
I wish he would, and that you would do so well that
he would keep you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That will do to say; but you wouldn’t help me
back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I would, and will. I will go down to the
office now, and ask Mr. Sands to take you back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will, after the mean way I have treated
you?” exclaimed John, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t bear any malice, John,” said Gilbert.
“Here, take my hand, and look upon me as a friend.
If I can’t get you back into my old place, I’ll try
elsewhere. Come, let us take the cars down-town,
and I’ll see what I can do for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What a good fellow you are, Gilbert!” said
John, much moved. “I am ashamed of trying to
injure you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You didn’t know me, then. But, John, will you
try to give satisfaction, if you are taken back?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I will,” said John, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Half an hour later they entered the broker’s office.
No boy had been engaged as yet. Mr. Sands did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>at first regard John’s application with favor; though,
as he understood the duties of the place, he could, if
he pleased, do better than a new boy. Finally, the
broker agreed to take him on trial.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Remember, John,” he said, “you owe your place
to Gilbert’s intercession. But for that I wouldn’t
take you back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know it, sir. I hope you won’t be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Here it may be said that John turned over a new
leaf, and succeeded in this last trial in giving satisfaction.
His cousin, Simon Moore, called him mean-spirited
for going back; but John felt that he must
look out for his own interests now, and did not regard
his objection.</p>

<p class='c010'>In his prosperity Gilbert did not forget Mr.
Talbot and his little daughter. While he continued
sick our hero allowed him a weekly sum sufficient
to support father and daughter comfortably; and on
his recovery he found him employment, and a more
comfortable lodging. Little Emma was no longer
obliged to go into the streets to sell bouquets, but
was put at a good day-school. From time to time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Gilbert called upon them, and was rejoiced to see the
improved looks and happier faces of Emma and her
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the first chapter of this story the reader will
recall John Munford, a school-friend of Gilbert, the
son of a carpenter, who, on account of his father’s
poverty, was obliged to leave school, and go to work.
Gilbert, in becoming rich, did not forget his early
friend. One day John received a letter from Gilbert,
in which, after speaking of his change of fortune, he
wrote:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, John, I have a large income,—much more
than I can use,—and I want to do what good I can
with it. I know you want to keep at school, but
cannot, on account of your father’s circumstances. I
have a proposal to make to you. Give up work, and
go back to Dr. Burton’s school. I will allow you
three hundred dollars a year till you are ready to go
to college. Then you shall come to Yale, and room
with me. I will provide for you in college. After
you graduate, your education will command a position
that will make you independent. Let me know at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>once if you accept, or rather write me that you do
accept.”</p>

<p class='c010'>What could John do, but to accept this generous
offer with deep gratitude to his old school-fellow?
Need it be said that Gilbert fulfilled his promise to
the letter. Last year the two friends graduated, both
taking high rank; and John is now principal of a
High School in a Massachusetts town. Gilbert has
decided to lead a business life, and has entered
Mr. Vivian’s establishment. He will be junior partner
at the end of three years. He may form another
partnership with a member of Mr. Vivian’s family.
I cannot say positively, but I think it quite probable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Briggs is no longer Gilbert’s guardian. Our
hero is of age, and has assumed the charge of his
own property. He is always sure of a cordial welcome
from Mrs. Briggs now, and Randolph cultivates
his intimacy; but Gilbert does not find him congenial.
He is inclined to be dissipated, and, I am afraid,
will not turn out well. But his mother upholds him
on all occasions; and her ill-judged indulgence is
partly the cause of her son’s lack of promise.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Gilbert sometimes visits the old boarding-house.
Mr. Ingalls is prospering. Alphonso Jones now
boasts of his intimacy with Gilbert. It is rumored
that he has offered himself to Mrs. Kinney, a young
widow, already mentioned, and been rejected. His
heart is not broken, however; and he is now a suitor
for the hand of Miss Brintnall, the strong-minded
school-teacher. She is “high-toned” in one sense,
at least, as he will probably find after marriage.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
